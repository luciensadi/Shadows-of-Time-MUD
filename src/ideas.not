25% of this mud is underage kids, who I doubt could make a trip somewhere

Subject MUD~
Text
Yes, we obviously need newbies. I'm curious as to how many players the
topmudsites brings in?! In truth, if someone could afford a couple
months of advertisement on TMC, that would be helpful as well.

Really, we just need to generate some tension between the players
that brings some more interest in the game. If everyone is standing
around with dicks in their hands, it's no fun. Lack of pkill and lack
of roleplay are the biggest parts to blame. Here's why I think that is:

1) Lack of pkill - Again back to my suggestion. You always know who is
on, where they are at, and where their backup is. So, either you safehug
because they have too many on, or they safehug because you have too many
on. Some anonimity would not allow that to happen. The mystery factor
would probably be more interesting as well.

2) Lack of roleplay - People are being forced to roleplay, or rewarded
with little carrots dangled in front of their noses. I think it should
be more of a necessity thing, and less of a "required" component. If you
restrict the who, and knowledge of where and who people are they will
"need" to roleplay to figure out who it is. This is more of a voluntary
thing instead of the, "Oh you didn't RK, so you're going to get punished."

Yes, I am re-visiting my idea, but I really do legitimately think that it
will help the problem. However, I think advertisement is a big part of the
equation. A lot of our players are also friend of friends. If our pbase is
declining, then that means not only are friends not telling friends, they
are stopping playing. We need to make it interesting and exciting to
play.

okay well as i stated before i have tons and tons of ideas to make this place
FUN and worth coming to.. we have been losing alot of activity and well frankly
the rp is at a stand still where everyone holds their cocks and talks about
quests that razumel gives them .. which in my opinion is not even worth rpin about
and i know because i've been to my fair share of RPonly muds where they were fun
.. but yeah to my point .. the problem as i see it isn't really with the areas
and with the recent builders we can pretty much take care of all the fixes that
needs to be done (myself, rolland and sellers) but perhaps we should hire a few
more coders? because as i see it the changes that REALLY need to be made is with
the code, don't get me wrong the code as it is is awesome but what i am saying
is tweaking and addons/new code .. and i know that the coders and imps will just
shrug this off because no one actuley cares about my input even tho i know i can
make this place get very populated and whatnot .. but if u decided to ignore it
then it's this places' loss and i really want this mud to be all it can be..

I agree with Demandred.  I think we could really up the pbase with
another coder or two tweaking (no demandred, not the kind of tweaking you
do.  Put the straw down), and coming up with addons.  It would be kickass if
we could get the pbase kicking like we used to have it.  Also, maybe more
quests would help keep the pbase happy instead of just content to quest all
day and do nothing else.  Oh yea, and maybe take off loots and rk for a lil
while again.  People seemed to enjoy it last time.  People tend to rp and pk
a lot more when they aren't worried that someone's gonna be out to loot all
their precious quest.

Everything I've seen on this mud has indicated that in the game of PK, practically everything
goes to the runner. Escape is easy enough against all but the best PKers, and just not talking
to people is enough to make sure no on has RK on you. If you make it so that people recall to
their guild areas, isn't that yet another blow against PK? If a BT attacks a WC and the WC
wants to get away that bad, they recall. Poof, they have a huge lead on their attacker now.
Or maybe rogues. Steal from a guilded player, and recall. By the time they can get back to
Whitebridge, you're halfway to Moria or Gleeman. Whichever you prefer.PK around here has
enough nails in its coffin already.

I personally don't believe there is anything with the Defense of Clerics.
I spent an hour fighting Shaula with my cleric yesterday and not once did he
go below 3 stars.  Clerics have a crappy offense, I believe their defense is
fine.  Upping their defense would turn a 1 hour fight into an hour and a
half or two hours.

1. Just freaking DISABLE word of recal during pk and make word of recal take you to your guild area or whitebridge if unguilded.
2. Hand of the Creator: Book spell bought from a QM for 2k qps, clerics only, High powered offensive spell not based on align and does not have a status affect attack

3. Give clerics ensnare or a movement damaging spell to hamper their opponents running ability.

4. If all else fails, just give them illusion. Theyre a freaking mage class and dont get it, however assassins and rogues get illusion because they don't have a lag based attack (Don't tell me Sim is our lag based attack cuz we get lagged more tha
than the opponent allowing them 1 ticks worth of lag to run like a chicken with its head cut off).  Make sense?  It shouldn't

and herbalist up and running .. and also maybe make a few new skills for certin
classes ... also i think that the CP's should be looked at and balanced out too
because there is quite the range... and finally take out red hand and add the
perrin and matrim "enhanced" chars meanin normal chars but perrin with old wolfbro
skills and matrim with RH skills .. making them the only ones with those skills
and perhaps those two and a real rand could make somewhat of a differeance to the

that other guilds will fill out more

Subject Balancing Equipment~
Text
This has bugged me for the longest time, and I'm in an argumentive mood now, so here I go.

On this mud, we worry dearly about balance. Balance between PK and RP. Balance between
classes. Balance in equipment. The last one is whats buggin' me the most. Is the equipment
really "balanced" now? Where is the balance between the Corrupted Tower Shield and the
Shield of the Lost? I'll tell you: there isn't. The Corrupted Tower Shield is going to
require you to fight your way through Jehannah, past dozen or more overpowered mobs just
to have a shot at the Big Man who possesses it, then you get to fight for well over an hour
to attempt to kill him. For one or two pieces of eq. Meanwhile... I get a couple of charmies,
hop into Shayol Ghul, and kill half a dozen mobs for about a third of set of level 75 stock
eq that is just as good. (no offense meant to Dreyus's area or Demandred's equipment, just
stating the facts as I see them)

Quest equipment, in many cases, is easier to obtain than stock eq. Sure, there shouldn't be
as much of it around as stock eq (in theory), but answer me this: how many shoulder pieces
do you see? Now how much Ghengei eq do you see floating around? And why? Immortals throw
us fantastic quests filled with bitter death and great fun, but everyone who didn't piss
off the immortal (and some who did) WILL end up with a piece of eq. On the flip side, that
same group of people down in The Bore will get only three or four pieces of eq for the
entire group. Want proof? Talk to the legends in Allen's last quest.

Am I making any sense? Am I missing something? I don't think that being quest equipment
should make it the best. I think that the equipment thats going to cost you the most time
and effort should be worth the time and effort. Anyone remember the Arcane Sanctuary? Our
personal deathmonger, Demandred, put it out for us several months ago. Its a huge, well
thought out and difficult area that would require a good sized group of legends to get
around and kill anything. Trust me, I lead such a group into it shortly after it was put in.
And as far as I or anyone I've spoken to knows, we were also the last group to go in. Hours
of works and dedication, lost because it requires effort that people don't have to put forth.
Why gather a huge group to go battle gainst overwhelming odds for great equipment when I can
go up from Pella and slay a few statues for equipment with the same points?

Okay, I'm done. Flame away.

I don't understand what the fuck your note meant.  You say EQ needs to be
balanced, but then all you talk about is the areas.  So what you are really
saying is the areas need to be balanced?  I hate to say it, but areas are of
different difficulty, and if they aren't it'd be boring.  If all areas were
shit ass easy, it'd be boring.  If all areas were shit ass hard, it'd get
old after a while going to an area and spending 3 hours for one piece of
stock eq.  If they were all in the middle, it'd be boring as fuck as well. 
If I'm entirely wrong on your note, lemme know.  But what it sounds like to
me is that you're saying some areas are too easy and some are too hard and
that they need to balance out.

Ok, I agree that Archimedes' note was very nicely thought out and planned
carefully, and most of it makes a lot of sense.  But for the eq part.  The
hard shit sure should be 8/8 etc...  But it should NOT equal quest in no
shape or form.  Ever.  Quest eq is quest eq.  The best eq in the game.  So
basically what Archi is probably saying is that AREAS should be balanced to
fit the eq.  Sure quest is easy to get.......  IF you find what you're
looking for.  Hell, id like to see you find some 75 warrior quest lying

Subject Mobbing.~
Text
From my experience, I've found a few things that tend to play through the rules of the
mud. Things that simplify mobbing, and that make even great and powerful mobs easy. Just
thought I'd share what I've picked up in hopes that, with in increase of actual difficulty
in mobbing, people will be more willing to accept other changes.

The first and most obvious are Tinkers and Chain Lightning. We can toss a CL out there with
a non-Tinker in the room, and bounce the spell off them like a lightning rod. Of couse, they
aren't damaged by this because Tinkers can't hurt players. This doesn't work the other way
around because players can't target Tinkers with hazardous spells. I would think a simple
fix to Chain Lightning would correct this.

Another is the stationary "ter'angreals" that builders sometimes use for special entrances
to areas.The room on the other side may be no_mob, but the portal still allows access to
mobs because they are not 1. walking in from NSEWUD 2. not entering through a player portal,
and 3. not being summoned. Again, a simple fix should correct this.

Many mobs that are otherwise crazy powerful are simply averted with a lone archer and maybe
a suicidal friend. The archer spams their shots, while the buddy runs in to donate the arrows
and their last corpse. Mob dies with relative ease, at the loss of... what, a little time?
Immunity to arrows is a common fix to this, as is removing no_mob rooms.

All I can think of offhand. Have fun, and feedback would be nice.

I think we need to address a real issue here.
Up the guild limits, allowing more people to join guilds leave the limit to 2 guilds though.

Subject Bug in Western Woods/Justin/Stephen quest~
Text
I don't know if it was meant to happen or what.  But I was trying to
finish the quest and i got pissed off.  So I went to Justin and said "Your
quest is too impossible, Justin."  "Now die."  As i said now die, he
proceeded to give me a potion of faith.  As I said now die again, he gave me
another...  And another...  And another.  I guess you get the picture. 
Sebastian and myself know about the bug, and we decided that I would note
it.  I shared it with noone else, and the only reason Sebastian knows is
because I was at his house when I stumbled upon it.  Might want to get that
fixed.  I don't think it'd be too funny to see a bunch of warriors/rogues
running around with air barrier all the time.  

Thanks,
Kindle

P.S. Sebastian told me to tell you he had like 150 on him, i have something like that on me as well.
Feel free to take them back, it's a bit cheap.
I don't really like the idea of other classes but mages having barriers in the first place.

Subject Gold~
Text
Gold is a key to a lot of PK, therefore is valuable.  It can be the
difference between winning and losing a pk.  Gold is also valuable in
mobbing.  It can mean the difference between a mob taking one hour and a mob
taking 3 hours.  Therefore I think gold shouldn't be as nearly easy to get
as it is.  Places like ghenjei that give you 2k gold for burning a chest. 
Or spend 30 seconds porting to jumanji, entering, opening a chest, getting
silver from a chest, recalling, going 2 north, giving 430k silver to raz,
and coming out with 4k gold.  Gold is valuable and should not be nearly this
easy to get.  

I suggest taking out these shortcuts.  Make people mob for gold, or quest for it.

Nothing on this mud is as strong as it could be. Thats sort of the point, we're seeking a
balance, not power. If they wanted power, dracs would be back to 8 mana to cast, assassins
would be picking players off left and right in one hit, and archers would be litterally
untouchable. While some may consent that we haven't reached that balance yet, I don't think
giving rogues the ability to first strike with every hit is going to be step in the right

Like, instead of theif ticks, they have loot ticks for like 24 hours after

their stuff gone, will have a way to get it back.  Not to mention, thieves
will take more caution in stealing, and not go crazy.

I actually like the fact that the who list doesn't show
guilds, and also that you have to remember someone through
rp still.  If these things were changed, I think this mud
would spiral further into AoL-ness and soon, rp would die
out altogether, making us no better than the average pk mud.

So it takes a little more than logging and looking at 
someone before you kill them, the added effort keeps us
from being lazy, or not giving all our effort to play here.

Subject My thing on Steal~
Text
Keep it, with a couple of procautions for folks.

1. Can we please get rid of the dumb "Tinkers can't touch looted eq" rule now? With loots
out, its become pointless I think. If you think someone is transing stolen eq to a Tinker
alt, lemme know. If you think I am transing stolen eq to my Tinker alt, tell Dreyus.

2. Improve the quality of the "curse object" scroll? I think we tried to do this once before,
but they seem to suck again.

3. Remove the "open_bag" skill. You might end up having to leave it on current rogues, but
it would at least keep people from making rogue alts just to steal with. Stick stuff in a
backpack, curse it, wham. Thats an unhappy rogue.

Using steal to obtain gold is sorta required for them, since even the legend rogues that
I've seen have trouble with mobs in combat. Maybe to add a little gamble in there for them,
allow people to loot coins from rogues/assassins (since yeah, Assassins have steal too) that
failed a steal on them.

Obviously something needs to be done about this.  I play a rogue and am
guilty of taking advantage of stealing gold from others knowing they can't
get it back.  But, Steal cannot be taken out, unless you wish to ruin the
only purpose of the class.  I quite honestly don't have a good solution for
the problem at hand...  But it seems to me that gold should be lootable. 
But, the only people who should be able to loot it should be those who have
it stolen from them, and they have to properly identify who stole it, that
way it can be looted from the original culprit.  Obviously a little bit of a

some suggestions for changing tinker:

*limit their inventory to 10 (random number) plus whatever they can wear

this would prevent tinkers from becoming storing characters, still enjoy the no_loot life, and bring their rp a little closer to the books (they were massacred)

Jubei's idea is half good.
Luthair's idea sucks.

Making loot toggable would only cause unwanted problems and loopholes.  Like
I once said in a previous note, loot should ONLY be an option at creation,
and should NEVER be reversable.  That way, you don't get those stupid players
who always look to stir trouble.

I had also said that Tinkers should be pkable, with noloot of course.  However,
the limit to 10 objects in their inventory would limit their use of not only
spare eq, but staves, potions, pills, herbs, food, and the list goes on.

What's the point in making someone auto-pkable if they're logged on for for
a certain amount of time, Luthair?  I don't see advantages, only disadvantages
and disincentives for wanting to log and stay logged on the mud.

you just wasted your time.  I think it would cause people to be a little
more careful about who they attack and who they don't.  I think it just

Text
With the support of a couple of mortals, I've come up with the basic
guidelines which would be the reasonable alternative to outcast.  We all
know that each person is placed in outcast when removed from their guild yet
not all players leave on bad terms.  The following is my idea which isn't
the final making but is open to changes and interpretation.  

Instead of sending players straight to outcast, they should all be sent to
a neutral guild where they await a "trial" of sorts.  This is so there won't
be any sort of influence on the GL in making their decision.  Guide will then
take all information and make a ruling based on what they were given.

Also, if you wanted, Guide could give an alternative punishment that isn't
as worse as the removal of 30%.  I refuse to believe that each case should
result in the placement in outcast and the removal of 30%.  There should
always be an alternative.

Diem, you could code a command for IMMs that removes a certain percentage of
a players skills/spells.        Syntax:  skillcut <percentage> <player>
`7                                Example: skillcut 10 tennovan

We should run a script that removes all characters under the level
of 20 that haven't logged in 30 days.  We should also run similar
on players under level 50 that haven't logged in 60 days and level
75's that haven't logged in 90 days.

Pfiles aren't that big but when you haven't cleaned house in over

Originally, warriors had no access to frenzy and bless.  So to make up for it,
warriors were given berserk, which is similar but wasn't as powerful as frenzy.
I'd also like to point out that berserk is a skill, and frenzy is a spell.  I
also think berserk has a bit more lag on it than frenzy does, not sure.

Frenzy can, therefore, be cast on others with the same alignment (I think) and
berserk is only usable by the user.

Subject Tinkers~
Text
Tinker's weren't that good at running, IMHO.  It was against their beliefs to fight,
and they did run, but they also died.  Instead of just making them pkable and such,
here's my idea.

Tinkers would become pkable.  They could be pked, and technically start a pk if
they so wish.  But if a Tinker starts a pk, and wins, he loses his guild status
and 5% of his stats.  The person who killed the Tinker loses 3 honor points and
will not be allowed to loot.  I mean, Tinker is still here for a reason.  But,
instead of them being nopk, they'll be noloot.  It brings more realism to da game
and allows all the shit-talking that once existed to cease all together.

So basically, the Tinkers can die but it does nothing to them.  This way, players
still won't kill Tinkers and the Tinkers don't have to worry about losing loots.
As far as eq hoarding, most of us have agreed that if you try to limit a Tinker's
inventory or hoarding, then you have to limit those who are lowbies, noloot, alts,
any player that doesn't log more than 5 hours a week, or any player that doesn't
leave safe or RP more than once a day.

Hoarding is hoarding, and Tinkers may store eq, but so do many others.

Subject Dual Wield~
Text
I sent this out as an idea a while back.  Dual wield is a great skill to
have as a warrior, but...  The one hit every other round isn't that great of
an advantage.  When you dual wield you lose the stats of a held and a
shield, not to mention the awesome defense that is shield block.  

Here is what I could come up with as a balancer.
A parry is when you use your weapon to push
an attack away from you.  So I think it would
make sense that if you're using two weapons,
you have twice the chances to parry.  I think
that wielding a second weapon should allow you
to have a 50% better chance to parry an attack
than if not dual wielding.  This would make up
for the loss of blocking.  I also believe that
since you are dual wielding, that's more of a
chance for you to hit someone that is NOT dual
wielding.  So maybe give dual wield an advantage
that will allow you to hit people that are not
dual wielding much easier than if they were dual wielding.

This would just bring back a cool, but unused skill
for warriors, assassins, clerics, rogues, and archers.

Well, I ask myself why I never idea and this is probably why.  Most ideas
are not put forth to bring a balance in the game between rp and pk or
newbies and legends.  We have a tendency to be either top heavy or having
the bottom fall out.  What I propose though and to walk a fine line both
sides can appreciate.  If Honor is liek prestiage then we can assume
something of value should be given to the glory takers.  And or a certain
amount of honor pts alllows your to get a certain type of eq.  Thus allowing
for the purchase of eq to keep an even flow of new items in the game to
encourage play over all or even for new items or things to be added to the
quest l ist.  We seems to appreciate more changes to and add ons to the
questmaster because its bassically the most active thing to do once hitting
75 or legend.  I know that we have advanced quests and such but the quest
list does seem a lil staginate as of late in items offered.  Maybe a few new
ones and more randomness to it would help elivate some tension on people who
just always seem to log and quest n ow.  However, I feel if we make more
things available to the general mud they won't seem to store things as much
or safe hug as much.  I visited a mud recently that the actual player was
more valued then the eq...  Basically meaning there was note a m emphasis on
the eq one had as much as he skills and spells of a player.  During creation
and upon joining a guild.  I'm not saying this is they way to go but its
something new and fresh for me to enjoy more in tailoring my player instead
of my eq for a change.  I will not name the mud for respect to them as well
as to us.  But it is wonderful food for thought.  And who mknows if you
actually take the time to look over this idea it may spring forth some more
that will bring better Balance to the changes being made over all and less
gripppin or bickering about people opinions and ideas.  Which to me seems to
just hinder the advancements that the imms are making as of late.  I can
tell Diem is getting to his wits end and I enjoy this mud and don't want him
just to turn around and say screw it and there goes the mud.  I want

Ok, Fm's,  We dont have dodge and parry, so actuall weapons probably void out 
our evade and block.  Not sure on this.  If this might be the case why not make a weapon
that utilizes martial arts.   Katars or wristblades, to be exact.  Make them work with martial arts

A few things that I've concocted. Its late at night. Lemme be.

1. If you want to make mobs harder for archers, mprog the mob to pick up the arrow, and
eat the arrow. Sounds like a good idea, right?
2. Give form masters counter. It just makes sense. They're living weapons, their bodies are
attuned to their surroundings, blah blah blah... allowing a guy who reminds me of the karate
kid to catch someone's wrist and bop them in the nose for their sluggishness just sounds fair.
3. How about instead of allowing us (mages) a bunch of wimpy mobs, how about one charmie with
full hp? The mob won't do all the work, it'll just let us have one faithful friend to talk to...
4. Once again, someone to point out that strike costs too darn much. Period.
5. Rogues are actually pretty balanced now. Kudos. I'd say ditto for clerics, but they seem
to lean heavily on simulacrum... but oh well, not bad otherwise.
6. Oh, and warriors. They're great too. Rock on.

i'll address a few things he brought up, but not all of them
first off perhaps the mprog may go in perhaps it may not but quite frankly it
would take assloads of extra work to make mobs chase archers and yet not be
everywhere in the area and very hard to keep the mobs in a special area, i'll
see what i can do but no promises.  second off FM's with counter .. well i sorta
agree with this idea cept for one difference if you think about it counter for
a warrior and counter for one trained in martial arts are much different things
a warrior would deflect a strike and follow up with a slash or strike of their
own .. where as someone trained in martial arts would block and or avoid then
grapple the subject.. immobilizing them and then counter with a powerful and or
percision hit .. so how bout this for form masters .. give them a special counter
where as if it goes off in a round the oppoents remaining attacks (depending on
when the counter goes off) would be nullified for that round and instead the
form master would get an extra hit in just like warriors counter.. here's an 
example ... warrior has 4 attacks 2 go off hitting or is dodges whatever yet on
the third attack the FM's counter goes off.. third attack would be switched with
FM's counter hit taking down the opponent and the a warrior's 4 and final attack
would not go off.. seems like a good idea .. 
perhaps strike should be lowered in CP cause it is hella expensive .. and maybe
tweak martial arts for the hits to do a little more damage .. but if u bring
in that counter i believe that would equalize FM's i it's entirety .. any comments?
and or backups seeing as the coder(s) don't usually listen to me ;) heh

Form masters aren't helpless schoolgirls.  Don't add too much and make
them overpowerful.  Before, mages and form masters were the top classes. 
Until they changes warriors to hit more then everyone and their mother made
a warrior alt, trust me i know, I was among one of the first 3 warriors or
so to legend.  Form masters are weak, compared to warriors in melee, but
given dampen, they can rock with mages.  As against rogues, they go
non-dispeled sanc, rogues wont hurt them much.  Clerics, well, i dont know
much, so I won't comment.  But they seem alright from what everyone is
saying.  Warriors are quite fine, now added the dual wield and better parry,
that makes them even better against mages, rogues but might help form
masters since they no longer can shield block.  Anyways, to cut it short. 
Everything seems fine, why not concentrate on mages to be updated with the
otherss?

Form masters are dealing quite less damage with martial arts, critical
attack could help that and boosting their melee a bit wont hurt either.  But
increase them as a whole, not give them dampen and make it harder for mages.
Mages are ok, but with all the changes of dampen, better hits and parry for
dual wield, it seems the odds are against mages.  Mages were tough cookies
maybe a year ago, but now.  With veil only to warrior type classes, mages
aint THAT strong.  I'm not saying all, but most.  Its cool to make changes,
but dont make that change hurt another class, its pointless.  Mages aint
strong anymore, they are just OK.  But with all these big changes, Mages
will be on the bottom of the list.  Mages versus rogue.  BJ and spelled down
would take too much HP from a mage to where dracs and fighting will be out
of the question.  Cept maybe you are a 4500+ mage.  Against warriors, well,
its a good fight before, but without veil for mages and dual wield is
increased, mages seem not to have much a chance.  Against FM, well, before
they could have a good chance to win, but now with dampen and possible
damage increase and again, lack of veil.  Mages are the under-dog.  Mages
were a BIG deal before, due majority to veil.  Some have skills, true, but
veil played a BIG part, if not the major p[art.  You've all fought forsakens
before, they drac you and drac you plus their melee and yet most legends can
bring a forsaken down quite far.  Now without the HP and melee of a
forsaken, you have a mage.

Heres a crazy idea.  Guild skills.  We used to have to earn them.  Now

each type of guild action would increase it.  Active log time would be the
part that affects it the least.  Since people can just idle all day.  The
next thing would be rp exp.  The more gained within the guild, the more
guildpts you would get.  Pk, if you pk and win you will recieve a chunk of
guildpoints.  Finally Quest points, quest points contributed will also add
to the counter.  What to do with the points is this.  Each guildskill should
have a set number of points to get Even GLs should have to earn this, and
GL's shouldnt be GL unless they hit the quota to be gl or appointed by

The problem with this idea is it sorta takes away from everything Dreyus has done in the
way of Guildleaders. He's given each guildleader the maximum amount of control over their
guild that they are allowed in hopes that the guild will become self-sufficient. And for
the most part, they have. As for gskills, most guildleaders, while I'm sure they see the
potential for using them as bait for more active logging and participating, also see the
wisdom of putting their guild members on the battlefield as well prepared as they can make
them. The guildleaders know that they can award their active members in other ways, and can
always punish inactive members in the simplest way possible - remove them.

I was thinking...  Yah I do that some time...  How about giving legends
something more across the board to work for once becoming legend that will
set them apart a little.  I knew they get special eq and such but how about
two skills they can add across the board ...  Meaning available to all
legends regardless of class.  Here is my brief but hopeful idea for Legend
Books .  

Book of extra attack - adding one more attack to the overall amount of attacks available per class. Sorta recycling the warder skill.

Book of Throwing - this would allow any class to throw a knife, dagger, spear, or basically whatever is possible to flag for throwing. And have it go up to 3 rooms if they have 25 dex or minimum 1 room for a low dex.

These two things could sell for about 5k qps in the quest list... and I think would add some more benefits to becoming legend.
And have players more active on one player then several...its not a major thing that will over balance one legend from another...though it will set legends a little more apart from those who are not, as I feel it should be for attaining legend sta
tus, as I feel it should be. Thanks!

Clerics would have to keep a mob alive while fighting another, and even help
in its attacks.  Warriors would have to seek and destroy a group of bandits.
Mages would be directed also to aid in a fight against a mob who is strong
against physical attacks but weak against magic.  Archers would have to
sneak around shooting bandits, without being caught, and if caught the quest
is over.  Well you can get basic ideas from where I am going with this, and
can easily add ideas to these.

Maybe when you get gnotes, in the subject line somewhere it has the
person in your guild's name in there.  
Example:
[  7 ] Scout: A scout arrives bearing news from Tony!
Or:
[  8 ] Messenger: A rolled up parchment tainted with the blood of Tony

That way, guildleaders could easily use the grep system to check how their guildies are doing without having to read each and every gnote to find out which ones involve the particular guildie

All the guilds now have their foes laid down by the current RP line, and nonguilded people
can either stay outa the line of fire, or make enemies as they see fit. If someone of, say,
Whitetower nukes you and you don't feel they had a reason, talk with their guildleader. The
guildleader has always been responsible for their guild's actions, and a guildleader should
deal with their guildee's actions. We don't need Guide to monitor us, or immortals to punish
us. We play this game to have fun, so we should do what we can to make sure everyone has
that opportunity.

Subject Toggleable who list~
Text
The idea is that each player would be able to determine whether they wanted to take 
advantage of this feature. They would be able to turn off and on the who list. While the 
who list is turned off, they could not be seen on the who, or use the who/whois/last 
function. If they turn the who list on, then they would not be able to turn it off again 
for a minimum of maybe 90 to 120 seconds. The purpose of this would be to give other 
players an equal chance to see that person.

It would be remarkably useful for scripting, and being deceptive to how many people you 
have on. For instance, one White Tower player could be showing on the who, but there could 
be 4 more with nowho on. It would be your responsiblity to scout out their potential hiding 
places, and take your chances.

It also would make you feel more comfortablea bout leaving safe, and not being attacked as 
often. This is good for newbies as well. I believe it could be a better solution to the 
previous idea I posted about restricting the who list, or Cadsuane's idea of an 
account-based who list.

Text
Install in the game an automatic check on players.  It would simply work
like this: Player A is level 46.  Player B is level 57.  Player B tries to
attack Player A.  When Player B types kill <name of Player A> the game
simply returns something like "This player is too low a level yet> or
something like that.  Same with steal.  Now, to protect the higher level
players from lowbie bastards who would try to use this check as protection
from getting attacked, the game would see the attempted attack or steal and
allow the higher level player to attack the lower level player.  The check
would be returned after pk ticks run out.  This system or one like it would
totaly remove the need for the MURDER and Theif flags by insureing that the

I threw this one out there awhile ago, but with all the worry over the wholist I'll do it
again... what if instead of the current wholist idea, we used a sort of "buddy list"? The
immortals and Guides would automatically be shown since, duh, they're immortals and Guides.
For the rest of us, we'd be able to request of people that they allow us to add them to our
buddy list, and know when they're on the mud or not. Since alliances change from time to
time, a person could choose to remove themself from another person's list and that person
would be removed from theres. (ex: Luthair adds Pren to his list, and Pren adds Luthair.
Later, Pren kicks Luthair's sorry ass so Luthair doesn't want Pren to know he's on anymore.
Luthair types "wholist remove Pren" and poof. Luthair can't see Pren, Pren can't see the

1. Iron Grip seems to only hurt the person who's weapon it is. Just don't use the spell.
2. OOL is easy to avoid if you just get people's names in RP, or from a reliable source.
and I don't think watching who and trying to remember them as they log on is very reliable.
3. Alignment serves more purposes than Iron Grip. It allows for stronger eq, protection
spells, clerics to do something besides spam Simulacrum, gives a moderate resistance to
damage due to certain equipment (the bless/dark flags do something, believe it or not), and
it entertains us when someone kills something and becomes naked.

then all you'd have to do is find a friend that would let you into a guild

I completely do not agree with the currnent circumstances of pk.  There
are situation that we have now that are unavoidable for someone fleeing and
dying that were not there before when we had word of recall in pk.  I was
apart of one of these incidents recently with an alt of mine.  I had an
archer attack I fled from the mob i was fightning on a quest rescue...  And
fled into another aggresive mob...  The mobsended up waxing me more then the
player i was trying to get away form so i could respell and then go after
them.  There is no telling the outcome if it wasn't for the mobs taking
about 70% of my hps.  Therefore, to say that there should be a penalty in
situations like that it needs to be readdress because that would be
completely unfair to the victim.  I'm all for tactful pking of other players

Subject Teleport~
Text
Okay, how about this... toss on a fourth string to it, to give a possible testination. For
example, "weave teleport Archimedes defender" would aim to teleport me to the first Defender,
and your level in reverse could be used as the modifier for success. In my above example, I
would have a 24% chance (100 - 76 = 24 so Sebastian can see it) of reaching my wanted destination,
and a 76% chance of popping up randomly in the area. However, you at least WILL end up in the
area your target was in. The reason for the math I use for the randomness is a sign that with
more power behind the spell, the easier it is for it to go waywards. Oh, and the spell would
obviously still be offensive if cast on someone else. Anyway, this would lower the risk of
"accidental" mob deaths, as well as making punishment for mob deaths in PK easier, like this:
You aim to teleport to Goul, its loggable and you're screwed. If you just aim for Tear and
end up in Goul, you're still screwed cuz, hey, you could have aimed for Ebou Dar or Tanchico
and been safe. Anyway, its 3am and I can barely see the screen cuz my eyes won't adjust correctly
to the computer monitor and I still gotta take that piss and go back to bed, so I'm done.

I was watching a show about a bunch of people reinacting the vikings and

shield time after time giving the swords man no chance to hit him.  This in
time hurt and wore at the swordsman and usually ended up destroying the
shield.  This is probably least of everyone's worries, but I suggest
something new for axe users.  I am not sure if they can hold something and
use a shield while wield an axe, but make it where they can't.  Let them hit
the person, while hitting the persons shield causing just a little damage to
the person when hitting the shield.  With chance of breaking the shield. 
Make his opponent have a chance of hitting less because they are shielding
the hits from the axe.  This would bring a new twist to axe.  Making them
more vulnerable to hits, but hitting more.  Don't even know why I am ideaing
this but oh well

One thing about axes, more specifically, bearded axes, that I am
surprised hasn't come up, is that the norse would have a relatively light
bearded axe in their left hand, and a heavier weapon (I.  E a bastard sword,
or double bearded axe) in their right.  As they came screaming into the
defensive line, they would use the bearded axe to hook over the defender's
shield, pulling it out of the way which had the effect of pulling the person
holding the shield into an awkward forward stoop, effectively denying the
defender the chance to stop ANY swing and exposing the back of the
defender's neck to a swing from the heavier, slower, second attack.  And, in
defense, the bearded axe was also extrememly good at parrying, as the hooked
part was perfect for catching an inbound sword.  So how about adding a
'hook' ability which would allow people with bearded axes to make up some of
their defensive disadvantages from dual wield, and also give them a chance
to get past someone's shield and deliver an almost automatic critical hit
(let me see, if you can get an easy shot at the back of their neck, how hard
should it be to inflict critical damage?)  .  Lemme hear what you think.

Make firestorm a damage modifier.  Reduce restrain to stopping all

just the opposite of the Sedai skill.  As for the firestorm, give some bonus
to damage or have a random chance to make a critical attack for spells
casting.  That could make Ashaman a little better.  If it doesnt work, take
it out, but I think it isn't over-powerful, since Sedai got balefire and
still.  Sedai stop channeling, Ashaman stops actions, balefire for damage
and firestorm as a damage modifier.  As for tap, reduce that a bit too if
need be, or keep tap but make the damage modifier for firestorm not as
strong as Sedai's balefire.

enchanted then placed in store and bought for a qp.  I don't think that
guild stores were allowed to be accessed by non gls, however, I know this
isn't illegal..  I don't think it should be allowed for them to do.  Please
have it hardcoded so that only gls can control what items are put into store
and the prices for them.  Thanks!

1. Kill the 1 tick disorientation on Teleport and replace it with the half your
movement cost like Word of Recall. We're hardened men and women who weave the
elements to our hearts' desires, darn it, a little trip won't disorient me!

2. No_quest the immortal quest areas and Jehannah. Jehannah is for the elite of
the elite mobbers in groups, not for some random 75 to go trampsing around in cuz
Razumel can't keep a better eye on great and powerful magical objects.

3. We love that the builders are putting in new areas and all, I swear we really
do, but how about finishing up some of the areas already out there, or removing
them entirely? Naseem Island, from what I heard, was a project of Cain's, and he
isn't even an immortal around here anymore. Teleport around sometime, and you'll
see how much more there is already out there that just isn't... done.

4. Cause the distance you can scan to be modified by the time of day when you're
outside. This one doesn't serve a real purpose beyond "its realistic and would
be cool", so skip this one if you want.

5. Bandage does have an effect, it increases your healing rate during the time in
which the bandages remain. Since the skill has an effect, and people who take the
default skills can get it, how about letting the rest of us gain it please?

Subject limited honor~
Text
Spinning off of what Shaula and Morin said in the last two notes about
honor, I think there should be a cap too, or at least it takes more deaths
to get negitive honor progressivly.  (Example: -1 honor means you have to
get killed twice before you go to -2 honor, then 3 deaths before -4.  A kill
always gives 1 honor, regardless of how negitive you are.  Like Shalua was
saying, if its always +1, -1: then that means for everyone with 5 honor,
someone else has -5 honor, or -5 honor is spread out over several people. 
The way that that math works, only half the mud will ever enjoy the benefits
of Honor.  If there was a cap or staggered loss, then that would 'generate'
additional honor besides there just being a +1 and -1 everytime someone
dies.

Text
Disorientation on teleport was added so that a player couldn't spam the spell
and perhaps escape fights by simply jumping around.  Though there are other
ways around it, and your idea is good, I think that unless word is put back
in, teleport lag should be lowered so there is a travel option while pk'ing.

I think the biggest reason that area's like Jehannah should stay in the quest
system is because you have your easy quests, then you have your hard quests.
I understand that Jehannah may be for the so-called "elite" but you have to
remember all those times you got the "Darkfriends Lair" qrets.... I mean
isn't that just too simple?  Balance.

The only reason areas aren't finish is because of the lack of building help.
As a former Headbuilder here, I know how hard it is to keep builders logged
and working.  Many have lives, many have mortal alts, many find reasons to
not log.  It's not feasible to hire 100 builders but it's not possible to
hire 5 consistant builders.

In the third paragraph, the word finish should be 'finished'.  I am too
lazy to go back and fix it.  And as for bandage, I'm all for letting people
gain it but I just don't think it's really been brought to the attention
of a coder.

I agree with Malcom, noloot should be no_steal.  I agree with Archi in a

hands, kicks and other shit, plus void kinda make them a bit too strong with
too many hits.  Also, the addition of increased damage to FMs ..  I'm
thinking, they do more hits than usual already, then can have void for a LOT
more, then had their damage increased.  With lastly, addition of dampen. 
Add it up, most attacks, chance of having void for a lot more, 25% off of
spell damage, undispelable ironskin, can't be disarm since they use their
hands, flip goes through air barrie , flyingkick, shadowkick, strike .. 
Higher dex than warriors, add all that up.  And I see ideas about weapon
flags for their hands?  Maybe tweaking a few of these down a bit.

Before I get into that: you have to move your arms to move a sword, yes? 
So logically, you'd have to be moving your arms pretty fast to move the
sword fast.  Arms moving at high speeds hurt when they hit you, yes?  There
you go.  FM's don't get the most attacks out of melee, a dual-wielding
warrior does.  "Increased damage" was making it so that fm's didn't only do
mangles, because if I wanted to be handicapped, i'd get in a car accident. 
Don't include void as an FM skill, there's only one fm with void.  I could
say "Mages are unbalanced cuz they can still veil" but that has nothing to
do with mage balance.  They can be disarmed if they're using weapons, which
they do sometimes.  And GASP, what about friggin' hand to hand!  Oh now
everybody's "undisarmable" Ironskin is undispellable?  Get over it, fm's
can't dispel you, either.  And ironskin absorbs less damage than sanc. 
Skick blows.  Fkick blows.  I can't believe you included strike in there at

Void isn't a method of sword forms... it's a method of concentration.
The Void(called the Oneness by the forsaken, and something wierd
that has to do with a flower by the Aes Sedai) is simply clearing
your mind of all external and internal distractions, feelings, etc.
With it comes a high form of concentration, which allows you to move
faster, think faster, and to a certain extent, ignore pain. Blademasters
DO, however, commonly use it as a method for increasing their skills
and abilities with the sword.

at war with [`$S`4eanchan`*].
at war with [`8Shadow`*].
allied with [`&Tower`*]
hostile toward [`!R`1edhand`*].
neutral toward all other guilds.

The idea is to give IMMs a look at which guilds are doing what if needs be, and to
give guildies a look at who to be careful of, who you can trust, etc. Also below is
an alternate configuration.

[`$S`4eanchan`*]        `!WAR!`*
[`8Shadow`*]          `!WAR!`*
[`&Tower`*]           `&Allied.`*
[`!R`1edhand`*]         `#Hostile`*
[`8Tow`4e`8r`*]           Neutral

To extend the idea out one step further, if everyone agreed that anyone should be
able to know whose doing what, then you coudl use the syntax "guildstatus <1st guild> <2nd guild>"

guildstat wolfbrother gleeman
`#W`3olf`#B`3rother`* is at war with `@G`2leeman`*.

guildstat gleeman wolfbrother
`@G`2leeman`* is hostile toward `#W`3olf`#B`3rother`*.

Its common sence.  And even if I managed to catch him and kill him I couldn't loot it back.
this needs to be changed.

How about if the big mobs, the ones that take four and five, and six

doesn't seem right to spend 5-10k killing something only to get 1 gold back.

A.  Dirt is not a heavy thing, i'm sure it can drift upwards.  B.  If

kick and possibly blind, just to even it out.  Uhm...  And if we're gonna

It would add a twist to pk with a rogue and assassin.  If you're a rogue
or assassin, if the person you want to fight wishes to dirt kick, then they
have to give up the advantage of being able to completely dodge trip.  And
the other way around.  If you want to dirt kick as a

they cannot attack back..  Perhaps we should make Tinkers noloot and make
them attackable, that way it would discourage players from joining Tinker
just to "stock up on quest gear" etc.  Etc.  Plus..  This can then make
non-tinkers ICly feel sorry for the Tinkers because they can get attacked

untouchable for PK, the ONE ASPECT of this game they DON'T partake in,
doesn't make them somehow less than any other guild.  Does any other guild
require an rp level, or 50qp tithe to the guild coffer per week?  Even Plaid
isn't exempt from at least weekly involvement in Arch's rules on staying
guilded.  So, peace to the guild, and try to remember that your brand of fun

I say we put these to use when we get a new surver and can make a big
change like this.  I think it'd be cool for guilds to actually be able to
purchase stuff with those guild qps like they were meant to be for.  Make
guild eq for each guild.  The price of the eq depends on the stats.  Maybe
make each hitroll/damroll 1k qps, so 10/10 guild eq would start at 10k qps. 
Each hp could add 10 qps, so 100 hp would add another 10k.  Flags like
nobreak and curse could add like 2k qps a piece.  Make it expensive so it's
hard to get, but it will give us something to donate the qps for.  Could
also make it so you can use qps to buy furniture and guild guards for your
guild area.  The better the furniture and the harder the mob, the more
expensive it is.  There are many possibilities we can use guild qps for, I
say once it's possible, we do it.

I think that the idea is nice, but make the price a little lower..I mean if
it is going to cost a fortune, why not just go out and buy quest gear yourself?
Maybe make it expensive to make the equipment, but after..make it cheap to get
for different guildees.  Btw..make it so that guidls can only use their guild eq?

Also in addition to the guild gards and such:

Maybe also have fountains, portals to different areas, more rooms, mobs, mobs with
mprogs, etc. etc.  The more you add the more qps it takes?

Overall, the idea is neat.

Think about it.  You pay a lump sum ONCE to get the eq made...  After
that you pay a MUCH lower price to actually get the eq as a guildee.  Or
hell, put ranks into play here too.  You have to be of a certain rank to be
able to get the guild eq.  Maybe code it so where only certain ranks can sit
on certain pieces of furniture in the guild area when it is bought.  But,
back on topic...  Yea, the eq IS only wearable by that guild, that's why I
said it should rot when you die in PK, and maybe just to reinforce the idea,
add a guild flag to guild eq just like class spec eq.  Both of your points
were addressed Logain, thanks for the feedback.

Subject Seals~
Text
We had these once and i thought it was a really cool idea, whichever side
got all of them got a huge quest, I think it was shadow vs the the mud, and
i don't know how this would work with the no-loot thing going on but i am
sure that the killed person would give up the seal if the are no-loot.  It
isn't like it affects their stats.  

Um anywayz my idea is to put the seals back in again, it would add something to rp
about and would encourage pk.

well it is a well known fact that many ppl log strictly to rp.. and knowing such
i have come up with an idea to create a RP Only area where ppl in this area will
be free from needless pk, npc's will be considered just like players if not lacking
in conversation, and NO Osays Pmotes inappropiate socials will be allowed save
for a  few OOC only rooms where ppl and discuss things and whatnot .. now if someone
decides to go ahead and attack someone for no reason the resulting punishment will
be a slay and choice item handed over to the victim.  After all if you want to
pk .. leave the area simple as that, also for ppl who are in pk ticks out of the
area will not be allowed into the area to run and whatnot .. punishment would be
a few hours in solitary confinement.  Let me know what you think on this idea
if u support it let me know if not then let me know.

I think that it's unrealistic that you can only practice a skill up to

bah.. too expensive?
just takes a lil time and patience.. every mage I've ever had had enchant weapon up to 100% fairly quickly

all you need to do is pick an area, like underdark, go thru, kill everything, and loot it all
once yer inv is full.. spennd a day or two spamming it, and I guarantee you'll least get 5-10 %..
all it takes is time.. and.. time isn't a factor when you look at a mud
because it's an open ended game.. you have as much time as you want to perfect it.
while consolidating spells is a decent idea.. a perfect coupon just makes it easier for those with lots of time, or
lots of ingenuity, to quest thier asses off, and buy a buttload of perfect skill coupons
therefore unbalancing the mud in favor of those who can sit there and quest constantly

Text
All I acn say is wow, the shear amount of change effects every area of
the mud as we know it.  IT all looks very promising, and very differenet. 
Im sure there will be tons of balancing issues, with EQ as well as skills,
but I really think this could bring the game in a new direction.  The mud as
it is is sort of static.  We can make minor adjustments yes, but the basic
play mechanic is quest for qp, get eq, pk.  While this is pretty fun (for
some reason), it is stale, and the overhaul could dramatically change all of
that.  

If I had to give an ida about what we could change, I'd say lets look very
closly at the magic system.  Magic in WoT works very different from how
it is in other games worlds, and the basic magic system reflects heavily
on the WoT world.  While there was an attempt at that by adding the 5 powers
system and putting the elemental weaves before a spell (which everyone turns
off :P), the essense of weaving a wave of earth with a trickle of fire doesn't
really translate over.

I propose a system where you have to be a certain level to do certian kinds
of weaves and you have to learn the receipes for weaves, (rush earth, trickle fire,
tie off earth). Anyway, just a thought, good luck on changes.

Text
Shadow isn't really a guild, its just a group of people with something sort of like similiar
interests. Therefore, I propose the following changes to the guild...

1. Remove Shadow as a guild. Turn their current gskills into normal skills.
2. Forsaken get the skills to start off with. Taint, Shroud, and Pray. No one else.
3. When a Forsaken accepts a darkfriend, they may choose to allow that player ONE of the
skills at their discression as to which one.
4. Forsaken would each be allowed no more than, say, 4 Darkfriends. Darkfriends can be just
about anyway... unguilded, guilded, legends, whatever. If a guildleader becomes a DF and the
guild finds out, they can post to the proper immortals to have them stripped of their title
and outcasted.

My reasons for this are simple: Forsakens would be required to work on their own and able
to make their own plans and actually work them. Perhaps Forsaken can see other shrouded, but
I'd suggest causing Shroud to be invisible to anyone other than imms and Awareness.

I'd also suggest having an immortal or two support Dreyus as Guildmaster, since it seems his
time on the mud is typically short and very, very busy. These immortals would just need the
ability to bestow and remove skills from players, at the request of a Forsaken. Once a DF,
always a DF until the Forsaken no longer exists, in which case they also lose their DF skill,
obviously.
