-1 CREDITS~
Syntax: credits
 
This command shows the list of the original Diku Mud implementors.
~

-1 ROM~
ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,  
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Athen, the sequel to the ROM code. It can
be found on Rehobaom's Legacy, at hypercube.org 9000.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth
    
Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)
    
Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)
    
Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)
    
Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander
    
Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world
    
The New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bugs reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches
    
Bug reports --
    Thanks to Shad Muegge, Jerome Despret, Phoenix, Will Hongach,
    Erwin S. Andreasen, Adam Debus and especially Gary Turkington
    (author of the ROM FAQ) for help spotting bugs
    
ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code 
was written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions
and ideas from the Merc list were used.  Portions of Rusty's work on
Moosehead also remain.

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle Taylor and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and 
wiznet are the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of   
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)

~
-1 SUMMARY~
Please refer to `&www.shadowsoftime.com`7 for a complete list of help files.
~
-1 QUIT SAVE~
Typing  "quit" will save your file and log you off the mud until you're ready
to return to your adventures here.  There is no requirement to raise in level 
before doing this.  If you should close your active window, without typing "quit" 
first, however, your charactor will register as "LINK-DEAD" and is vulnerable
to the whim of the mud, so be sure to save and quit out properly to protect
yourself.
~
-1 RENT~
There is no requirement to rent space on this mud for storage of your charactor.
See "`^Help Store`*" for information on owning a business.
~
-1 DICE DOTS CROWNS~
The games of dots and crowns are based on the games from the books themselves.
The premise is easy: the one who rolls the combination ot dice with the highest
total value is the winner of the roll.  Upon starting the game, you have 75
seconds to roll the dice.  If the time passes without the player host rolling, 
that person gets kicked from the dice game.  After the first roll, each player
has 45 seconds to roll, once it is their turn.  The ante of each roll is 
determined by the host player of the game, and each player throws in a matching
amount of quest points before each roll.  If a player cannot cover the amount 
required, that player is kicked from the dice game.  Winning cast gets the pot.
In the event of a tie, each player that rolled the tying high roll splits the 
loot.

`$COMMANDS`4:`*
`&dice start <type><bet> `*- Starts the game.  Type can be either crowns or dots
`&dice list              `*- Lists all current games and hosting players
`&dice join <name>       `*- Join a game started by <name>
`&dice leave             `*- Leave a game
`&dice status            `*- Information on the game you are in
`&dice roll              `*- Rolls the dice on your turn

`@KEY THROWS`2:`*
-In Dots, rolling all ones is called the Dark One's Eyes and you lose.
-In Crowns, rolling all crowns is a Crown, and you win.

`&Crowns pieces are (besides not being pretty):`*

`! Castle     Rose      Crown     Time      Torch    Shield`*
`!|`***  **`!|   |`* *** `!|   |`** * *`!|   |`* *** `!|   |`* _*_ `!|   |`** * *`!|`*

`!|`***++**`!|   |`*  *  `!|   |`******`!|   |`* *** `!|   |`* |+| `!|   |`* *** `!|`*

`&Dots pieces are the more familiar:`*

`!|`*     `!|    |`*  *  `!|    |`*  *  `!|    |`**   *`!|    |`**   *`!|    |`**   *`!|`*

-1 SCRIPTING~
Scripting on Shadows of Time is legal and there are guild training mobs that can be
used for this purpose. A warning to all: `!If you are scripting out of safe and DIE,
the Immortal and Guide staff will not reimberse any lost items or corpses. DO SO AT
YOUR OWN RISK.`*
~
-1 FLAGS THIEF MURDER~
A flag is a marker of sorts, attached to a players name in the "who" list.  There
are a variety of different flags, each denoting a different thing, from guild
flags, to tourney flags.  Flags are colored and in obvious positions to clearly
display the fact that they are not player-created, but rather a function of the 
mud itself.

To find out what each flag means, simply type "`^help <flag>`*"

Of special note are the THIEF and MURDER flags.  These flags, if seen, give notice
to the mud players, that the wearer of the flag has been branded by guide authority
as either a murderer, or a thief.  The most common way of gaining either flag is
by stealing or killing another player out of your level range, see "help pk".

~
-1 TOURNAMENT TOURNEY~
Tournaments are designed with both newbies and experienced player killers in mind. 
It is geared towards newbies allowing them an environment free of the worry of 
losing equipment, and rankings where the more advanced players have little reason
to stalk weaker players. More experienced players are rewarded with quest points
as they advance in ranks, and are forced to play against similar ability opponents. 
The tournament is based off of reputation and not just kills and deaths. You advance
ranks based on your reputation. The reputation is broken down as follows:

`@Killing`2:
You gain 1 rep for every rank of the player, and an additional 1 rep if they were
higher rank than you.

`@Dying`2:
`2-1`7 rep if they are same rank or higher.
`2-2`7 rep if they are `21`7 rank below you.
`2-3`7 rep if they are `22`7 ranks below you.
`2-4`7 rep if they are `23`7 ranks below you.
`2-5`7 rep if they are `24`7 or more ranks below you.

`$REQUIREMENTS`4:`7
You must be at least level 75 to participate.
A minimum of 3 players must join to start the tournament and to maintain it.

`$SYNTAX`4:`7
`&tournament start`7         - Opens a tournament if one is not already in progress. 
`&tournament start <rank>`7  - Starts tournament with a cap on the highest rank allowed.
`&tournament start noguild`7 - Starts tournaments excluding all guild skills.
`&tournament join`7          - Allows you to join a tournament already started
`&tournament leave`7         - Drops you out of the tournament (You can't leavein PKTIMER)
`&tournament ranks`7         - Lists all ranks, their reputation requirements, and rewards
`&tournament who`7           - Gives the stats of every available player currently online
`&tournament spectate`7      - Allows anyone to view the channels and see the carnage
`&who tourney`7              - Shows all players who are currently in an active tournament
`&ttalk`7                    - Global channel for all Tourney players to conversate
~
-1 LEGEND GUILDLEADER~
Legends are the highest attainable level by a mortal, but not by normal 
means. Through hard work and constant attention to your character you
can grow strong enough to attain this. Also available to Guild Leaders
is the GUILDLEADER rank for those who are also Legend. LEGENDs are level
76 and GUILDLEADERs are level 77.

`$SYNTAX`4:`7

-1 STOREKEEPING SEDIT~
Player/Guild run stores may be bought by any player/GL who has the store

buying a shop is 1000 quest points for an individual or 2000 quest points
for a guild.  Once you have a store and you can add items to it's shelves
which will be described shortly. In order for customers to purchase either
the person who bought the store must be present or a shopkeeper must be
hired. All commands are done through the "sedit" command.  All advertising

-1 'CHARACTER TRADING' 'CHAR_TRADING' 'CHAR TRADING' 'CHAR SHARING' 'SHARING' 'CHAR_SHARING' 'CHARACTOR SHARING'~
Starting 4/16/2001 Character trading of any kind is now illegal.
You cannot sell, give away, or come up with any other way of trading
characters. If you do get caught trading a character, both parties 
the trader and the buyer will be deleted.  Please don't make us have   
to enforce this rule.

Included under this new rule is the concept of character sharing.  If
the player behind a charactor is not able to play his or her char,
he or she will not be entitled to make use of the benefits of having
their character played by anyone else in the interim.  This includes
such things as paying someone in qps to level a char you have created
or to log your char in order to buy something off the quest list in
your absence.  Such practices take away from other players what they
deserve for actually being logged on at the time.

-1 NOTE NOTE CHANGES NEWS IMMNOTE IDEA UNREAD RPNOTE GNOTE STORE SNOTE CATCHUP~

                           store.  Player to player transactions spam up
                           the boards, and will be deleted.
~
-1 MULTIPLAYING~
On Shadows of Time, it is illegal to have two or more connections
to the mud. You may not in any way log two players at the same
time. Have two difference characters is fine, just do not have 
them on simultaneously whether they are linkdead or both active.
     
You cannot use a higher level/stronger character to weaken mobs for a
lower character to kill. To may transfer equipment from one character
to another, but you may not sign on both characters and give the eq
from one to the other. You must either drop the equipment, sign off,
sign back on as the other character, and pick it up. You could also
give it to a willing friend to hold untill you sign on the other 
character. You also cannot have someone else log your character 
and then level or interact with that character with an alt.  Any
form of interaction with one of your alts, is illegal.

Ignorance is no excuse. You will most likely be punished in some way
for multiplaying.
~
-1 PKILLING PLAYERKILLING MULTIKILL LOOTING SAFEROOM PKTICKS SUICIDE DUELLING GROUPING~
This is a playerkilling orientated mud. What does pk mean? It means that you
can kill other players. However, there are restrictions on this mud which all
players must follow.

`!* `&PKRANGE`7 - You may only kill players within your certain level ranges.
'help pkrange' will give you a list of acceptable level ranges for your level.
Also there is no pkilling from 0-35 unless you turn PK on (by typing 'pk' twice).
Tinkers ('HELP TINKER') cannot be killed at any level. Only newbies are allowed
to pursue joining this guild.

`!* `&OOL`7 - Killing players out of normal ranges is permitted, but has some
serious considerations to account for. For instance, if you kill someone out
of range you can obtain a Criminal and Murder flag. These flags prevent you
from being safe for around 300 ticks, as well as giving your IMMEDIATE loss of
stats such as hp/mana/move. If you die with this flag the resulting loss of
stats is even more drastic than simply acquiring the flag. You must have a 
valid roleplaying reason as always. So, be wary.
	
`!* `&ROLEPLAYING`7/`&ROLEKILLING`7 - You must establish a `!LOGABLE`7
roleplaying reason to attack.  By logable, we mean conversations on any of the 
logged channels, such as the say channel, whisper, or rpnotes.  Only real
legitimate reasons apply. This is not "I felt like it", "My character is insane",
or "They had EQ I wanted". Make sure you 'help roleplaying' and 'help rolekilling'
for guidelines and examples to follow. Each of your characters is treated as
seperate and needs a seperate reason. Knowledge cannot be passed between alts.
`!Each time you kill someone, you must have a new and seperate reason for the new
attack.`7 Statute of limitations applies.  If you have a reason to kill someone,
do it within a two week real time period, else the memory of your charactor's 
reason fades, and you must RP it fresh.

`!* `&MULTIKILL`7 - After killing a player there is a 24 hour period (from the
time of the first kill) that you may take no aggressive/undesired action. This
includes attacking without the intent to kill, killing, mobstealing, etc. You
may have rights again if they attack you within that time period, but only if
they attack you yourself or a member you are grouped with (at intial attack). 
This rule is intended to prevent `!harrassment`* of players, and in that same
spirit, if you are seen as deliberately provoking a player you have already
killed once, then you can expect action from the staff, or guide.

`!* `&COMMON_SENSE`7 - If it seems wrong, then it probably is wrong. "Well it
seemed right to me?!" That's not quite enough. It follows the guidelines by which
the staff considers, and if you have not yet come to understand what we consider
common knowledge then ask. Above all, breaking any rule is not bound by your 
ignorance. If you didn't know, then you should have asked.

`!* `&LOOTING`7 - When you kill someone you may choose one item from the corpse
they leave. Any item that is retrieved from another players corpse
is flagged with a "pkill" flag cannot be touched by Tinkers ('HELP TINKER'). 
Item reimbursement from Guide judgements are the sole disgression of Guide.

`!* `&SAFEROOM`7 - Certain rooms like Healer in Midgaard are safe rooms, and you
cannot initiate attack in those rooms. However, if you initiate attack out of safe
then you can be attacked in safe rooms.

`!* `&PKTICKS`7 - When attacked you suffer 120 seconds of being able to be attacked
no matter where you are. Each time combat is re-initiated this counter resets. After
the counter has expired you may return to a safe room without fear of attack. Also
you can put %T in your prompt ('HELP PROMPT') to see how long it has left.

`!* `&SUICIDE`7 - If you kill yourself to avoid dying to a player, you will be
severely punished. In most cases the person who you were in combat with will get
double loot (4 items). This will not be tolerated, and repeat offenses will be
handled even more severely. Accidental death will only result in single loot (2
items). Both will be determined by [`#G`3U`#I`3D`#E`7].

`!* `&DUELLING`7 - Sparring is protected to a degree. If both parties agree prior
to the attack then they must both follow the guidelines they set. For instance, if
it is to the death no loot, then neither may loot. This however does not prevent
others from coming to attack provided this was not organized by one of the party.
For example, if Player 1 spars with Player 2 and Player 3 jumps in that is legal, 
but not if Player 3 had planned this with Player 1 or Player 2 before the attack.

`!* `&GROUPING`7 - In instances where you are grouped with players of a different level
range, particularly when pleveling, rules are slightly different. While grouped you
may autoassist without regard for level. You must be priorly grouped and in the same
room as the original attack. This only applies if you are attacked. You may not
participate in any way if your group member is the one who initiates. This only applies
to roleplay justification for defending a group member. You can still be retaliate if
you weren't in the room as the initial attack, if you have previous roleplay reason.

`!* `&DECLARE_WAR`7 - GLs must have more of a RK reason to issue orders to a guild.
When they issue orders to kill then they also carry the burden of fault if the reason
was not sufficent. Also, GLs cannot order an entire guild to be killed without first 
declaring war. War must be accepted by the GLs of both guilds, and posted in RPNOTE. 
The war is over once there is no opposition like when all the GLs of opposing sides  
have sent a surrender RPNOTE.

`!*** `&NOTE`7: These rules apply to all characters whether guilded, unguilded, or in
[`@OUTCAST`7]. All issues will be resolved by [`#G`3U`#I`3D`#E`7]. Complaints taken  
up in public channels can only hurt resolution of an issue.
~

-1 'GUILD AREAS'~
Protection of your guild and an organized base of operations is essential for everyone.
Most importantly is the security of that base, and you are within your rights to use
whatever means to protect that. This applies ONLY to the section of your area which is
barred entrance by a key. Furthermore if someone has a key to your area, and you are
able to verify this (not just because you suspect), then it is justifiable to try to
re-obtain the key. Attempting to kill mobiles outside the area, including ones that have
keys are not justification, because they are not inside the area.

`$RULES OF THE AREA`4:`7
`^* `7You may have an increased rate peice of furniture up to 50% spread out however
you like (IE: 125% heal 125% mana, 100% heal 150% mana, but neither may go below 100%).
It must also not be a safe room.
`^* `7There may be no increased rate healing inside the guild area.
`^* `7Anyone regardless of guild must have access to obtaining the key (though it may
be made extremely difficult to get, but not impossible). This also means it must be
held outside the barred section of the area.
`^* `7Equipment may not be placed inside restricted areas, excluding keys to deeper
sections of the guild area.
~
-1 PKRANGE MURDER CRIMINAL OOL~
A range has been set up for legal killing without reprocussion. You must
still have a valid roleplaying reason for attack, but this range is to
avoid a Criminal or Murder flag. While you have one of these flags you
are not safe at any time.

`&1-10       `^No PK`7
`&11-15      `^  2  `7
`&16-25      `^  3  `7
`&26-35      `^  4  `7
`&36-45      `^  5  `7
`&46-55      `^  6  `7
`&56-65      `^  7  `7
`&66+        `^  8  `7

`$*`7 : No PK        - Cannot be attacked by anyone
`#*`7 : Out of Range - Attackable, just not legally by you
`!*`7 : In Range     - Able to be attacked, just follow other guidelines
~
-1 COMMON SENSE COMMON_SENSE~
First we will start with a little definition.

`&common sense`7 - practical judgment based on exerience or native
intelligence, and not on education or training.

So relative to the mud what does that mean?  It means using your
real life experiences to dictate how you act.  For example if  
in real life Johnny doesn't like you and starts pounding on you
then his friend Jack comes up and says hey Johnny don't hit him
with your hand you might break a nail, here take this crowbar.
When you go to the cops, or go find your gun are you going to   
be going after Johnny because he's the only one that helped you,
no you're gonna go after both.  That's just one example meaning
if you help someone in pk then you are now a target for whoever
they were in a fight with.
  
There are many more examples than that which I could make for
other situations, but I know the average attention span and you're
already not reading this so I won't bother.  However just use
common sense and realize that not using/having common sense   
will not keep you safe, it's based on general common sense not
yours.
~
-1 RULES~
Guidelines are set for smooth play and consideration for all players. This
is to ensure a balanced and even playing field. Please type "help <topic>"
on any of the following sections for subcategories. All of these files are
required reading, and you are responsible for following them regardless if
you read it or not:

`&COMMON SENSE`7      : The Golden Rule. If it seems wrong, then it is wrong.
`7                    Above all is, if you aren't sure then ask.
`&PKILLING`7          : Read this thoroughly, and follow it completely. Severe
`7                    penalties are enforced if these are broken.
`&ROLEKILLING`7       : RP enhances the mud and is required for PKILLING. Use
`7                    this in conjunction with "help ROLEPLAYING"
`&CHARACTER TRADING`7 : Follow this policy, because you worked for the
`7                    character, and not someone else. Leveling is easy on
`7                    this mud, and should not be a bargaining tool.
`&MULTIPLAYING`7      : More than one character is not allowed to be connected
`7                    at one time. This includes one of them being linkdead.
`&GUILD AREAS`7       : Guidelines and rules for guild areas.

New additions may be added at any point. Check this file religiously.
~
-1 RKING ROLEKILLING~

You `!HAVE`7 to rp whether you are in a guild or not. Typically guilding
only adds to the roleplay and you still have your character's individual 
persona which includes their nationality.

A basic rule of thumb is: You must establish a `!LOGABLE`7 reason for 
the kill. This must be a valid reason and not simply, "I felt like it",
"My character is insane", or "They had EQ I wanted".  By logable, we mean
conversations on the rp channels such as say, whisper and emote.

What do you do if you feel you are PK'd without valid RP reason?
`^Send a note to Guide regarding the situation, time frame, parties
involved, looted items, etc.`7

`@NOTE`2: `7Who list, titles, equipment are not roleplay so they cannot
be used in justification of a pkill (IE: if they are wearing a cadin'sor
that doesn't mean that they are an Aiel and you can kill them). It is also
not roleplay justification to kill someone because they are veiled, have a
damane, wolf, etc, you must speak to them, or about them on logged channels.

Make sure you read "`&help roleplaying`7" and "`&help pkilling`7". 
~
-1 RPING ROLEPLAYING~   
Below, you will find an indepth look at roleplaying on this mud, provided by our
friend Deviant.  While we cherish the file, and his views are accurate, we would
like to preface with a few shorter bullets:

 -We the staff, expect you to play your charactor in as much of a roleplaying 
  manner as you do a player-killing manner.  The two elements of this mud are
  entertwined.

 -If you intend to kill your fellow players, then you must play out the kill 
  through your own charactor's actions and emotions.  Just as in real life, 
  the killing of another human being is a serious matter, and we expect you to
  treat it that way.

Now on to a closer look:

Roleplaying is, simply put, the 'assuming of a persona'; the 'playing' of a 'role', as
assuredly as you might find in a broadway production, movie, TV show, or other work of
entertainment.  A true roleplayer immerses him/herself into the part that they have chosen
to play, and sees 'life' through the eyes of the character that they imagine themselves
to be.  What does this mean here on Shadows of Time?  Well, first of all, to be a good
roleplayer here it might help if those seeking to fulfill a part have read 'The Wheel of
Time' series of books written by Robert Jordan.  That is what this MUD is based upon.
This does not mean that one of the characters from the book has to be chosen for the basis
of the characters made, though.  In fact many roleplayers find it much more enjoyable to
create their OWN being, and make them heroic (or villanous) in their own rights - and in
the end, much more satisfying.  Others find their joys in assuming a character already
defined within the books; perhaps because they identify strongly with that character, or
perhaps because they want to explore something not brought out in the stories that have
been already told.  Whatever the case may be, understanding the 'world' that a character
exists in and forming its image in the ways you want to play it, is a first and critical
step.

Choose a name!  This step can be a difficult one.  A character should be given a name
that fits with the flavor of this particular world.  Do not make names that would ruin
the overall atmosphere, like "Bubba" or "Retard".  Neither of these names is either heroic
nor particularly fear-inspiring.  They only serve to throw someone who is really trying
to roleplay out of their stride.

Now what?  Here is the tricky part.  The best piece of advice that can be given when
asked about roleplaying is:  LIMIT YOUR KNOWLEDGE!  What does this mean?  It means that
while as "Ceranos the weaponsmith extrodinaire" might know all there is to know about
making a master sword from two coconuts, a dead plant, and some cotton, "Banoth the
village idiot" would not have the first clue about how to do such things and would probably
look at you quite dumbfoundedly or cut you down to keep your form of madness about the
world.  That is an obvious example.  Something less obvious would be like having more
than one character on the MUD.  But those characters have to ask themselves: "How would
'Organath of Tear', who happens to see an Aes Sedai battling a Seanchan, be able to
telepathically transmit that knowledge to 'Hoboh the Warder' who is 'waiting somewhere
out there in limbo' (tranlation: logged off because you are both characters.)?  In fact,
would he even care?  Better yet, how would 'Hoboh the Warder', who sees another warder
mention where an item is in the game lying around on the ground, communicate that to  
'Gothorp the Seanchan', who is logged off?  Actually he would probably just as soon cut   
cut Gothorp's throat as to tell him something like that.  The moral of these stories being:
LIMIT your character's knowledge to what the CHARACTER should reasonbly know, not to what
the PLAYER knows.

There is another part to that:  character interaction.  When you roleplay with another
player on the MUD, whether that is talking to them or trying to stick them with a sword,
try to react as the CHARACTER would react.  Does the character have a magic crystal ball
that tells him/her who a person is, what their loyalties and guild ties are, and how  
strong they are just by looking at them?  Hell no.  Keep your limitations in mind as well.
Roleplay them!  If a character is too low to fight someone, do not go challenging them 
as if you want to fight them - play out an injury, an absence, or some other reason IN  
character to explain the inability to fight.

This brings up the final point regarding roleplaying:  Pkilling.  Any member of a guild
who wants to kill someone needs to have arrived at the decision to kill them through the
process of roleplaying.  You should not be out there saying "Oh, I want to kill Jozal,
what reason can I think up to kill him/her?".  Instead, if you decide to kill someone,
it should have come about as a consequence of you acting as you feel your character would
do in that situation.  Generally speaking, the administration of the MUD will have little
or nothing to do with this process; they will NOT be in the habit of investigating pkills
for 'roleplay' reasons.  This will largely be left up to the players and mortal guild
leaders to handle.  If the administration staff feels a guild is sliding into a mediocrity
as far as roleplay is concerned, the guild leader will have to answer for it (up to and
including the loss of his/her position).  Keep in mind that if someone kills you, they
may very well have a roleplay reason for it, and they are certainly NOT required to
announce this or justify it to you.  Eventually, any person who is just a rampant pkiller
will be spotted and dealt with accordingly.  Now, if a person is NOT in any guild, then
there are really no roleplay restrictions on who they kill or why.  They may just simply
be roleplaying 'Zapert the skitsofrantic psychotic kill guy'.  That is fine.  These people
will have few friends, no benefits of guild skills or guild members, and eventually too
many enemies to do much more than log on a few minutes at a time.

Please read "`&help rolekilling`7" and "`&help pkilling`7" for how roleplaying is
integrated into this mud with a unique twist.

-1 NEWBIE~
        Welcome to `&Sh`7ad`8ows `&o`7f `&T`7im`8e`7! Please read this
entire file, and feel free to reference any other sections referred to.
This is to help learn specifics to this mud, and mudding in general. 
Also, typing "help" by itself will display a directory of help topics. 
Any command is in quotation marks to show you what you can type. For 
example, "who" would mean you type w-h-o.

`@NOTE`2:`7 This file is very lengthy and will take several minutes to read.
It's recommended that if you find this too lengthy and want a better
format, that you log onto `&www.shadowsoftime.com`7 and download the
text version of this help file. Also this isn't meant to be read once and
disregarded. You will use this several times in order to become familiar
with the mud, and how it works.

What do you need to know as a beginner?

`&COMMUNICATION`7     - How to conversation on the mud, write notes, etc.
`&NAVIGATION`7        - Moving around in the game is an important part of
                    the game. This section also gives tips for hunting
                    mobs, etc.
`&EQUIPMENT/OBJECTS`7 - Where do I put this? How do I wear it? This will
                    familiarize you with generally how to handle items
                    and what you can do with them.
`&FIGHTING`7          - Kill, kill, kill. This is just a general outline
                    of the commands you'll need to know to get around.
`&MUDSCHOOL`7         - The first steps are the most difficult, and the
                    section on leveling will take you step by step of
                    what to do. 
`&LEVELING`7          - After graduating from Mud School this will give
                    you and idea of what to do and where you should head.

Once you have learned the basic elements, what's next?

`&INTRODUCTION`7      - To enhance roleplay you don't initially know the
                    name of a person when you see them and see just their
                    age, nationality, and sex. This is how you remember them.
`&CHANNELING`7        - Brief description of how to use spells.
`&QUESTING`7          - Another important element to the mud besides just
                    levelling.
`&CLASS`7             - Brief description of what you need to know to play
                    a specific class.
`&CUSTOMIZE`7         - List of commands you can use to help tailor your
                    mud environment to fit your style of play.

Mastered the game and looking for a challenge? There's still more.

`&BOOKS`7             - Advanced skills and spell that can be gained by
                    studying a multitude of books.
`&TOURNAMENT`7        - Once you hit 75 you can enter into the world of
                    guiltless carnage, where you can win/lose but never
                    find yourself with lost equipment.

Still having trouble? More questions? Just type "`^novice <message>`7" and
ask for a hand. If you get no response then give "`^ooc <message>`7" a try.

Find anything missing? Something unclear? "`^help note`7" and write one to
"imm" with your suggestions. Any input is helpful and always considered.
~
-1 COMMUNICATION NOVICE OTELL TELL ITELL REPLY IREPLY OREPLY OOC SAY OSAY~
`$COMMUNICATION`7 (`4How to ask for help`7) - The first step is letting
people know you are new to the mud and need help. This help system will
be of benefit, but interaction with players will really give you a good
idea of how things work. Experiment with the commands and ask them
questions about anything that is unclear. 

   `!*`7 "`&NOVICE <message>`7" - The first command you should type once
   you read this is something like, "`^novice help me I'm new`7". From 
   there others will be able to help you, and guide you through each step
   of the development of your character.

   `!*`7 "`&WHO`7" - Shows a list of all visible players on the mud

   `!*`7 "`&TELL <name> <message>`7" - Sends a private message to the target  
   person that only they can see. IE: "otell diem hi" would tell the player
   Diem 'hi'. NOTE: This only works on people who are visible to you. This is
   also out of character. For in character use "itell diem hi".

   `!*`7 "`&REPLY <message>`7" - Sends a private message to the last person 
   who sent you a tell, regardless of whether or not they are visible to you.
   Useful if a 'Someone' sends you a tell. This is also out of character, and
   to send in character you would use "ireply".
 
   `!*`7 "`&OOC <message>`7" - OOC means Out Of Character. It is used for
   idle conversation not related to your character. It's also a  
   global channel so everyone on the mud will see these messages.
   When you need help, this is the first place to try.

   `!*`7 "`&SAY <message>`7" - Displays a message to everyone in the same 
   room as you (people you see when you type "`^look`7"). This is used
   for IC (In Character) discussions related to your character.
   If you do not use this for roleplaying then you can be punished
   by losing rpexp (roleplaying experience), since you gain rpexp by
   using says and emotes ("`^help emote`7").
 
   `!*`7 "`&OSAY <message>`7" - Used for OOC messages to everyone in the  
   same room. NOTE: We recommend that if you have a habit of using
   "`^say`7" that you type "`^alias say osay`7" and "`^alias ic say`7". This
   changes it so when you type "`^say <message>`7" it will say "`^osay
   <message>`7" instead, and when you want to use IC messages you
   would type "`^ic <message>`7" which would show "`^say <message>`7"
   instead.

   `!*`7 "`&WHISPER <name> <message>`7" - Sends a private message IC (In
   Character) to a specific person. They must be in the same room as you
   however.

   `@EMOTE`2, `@NOTE`2, `@DEAF`7
~
-1 NAVIGATION MOVEMENT~
`$NAVIGATION/MOVEMENT `7(`4How to get about in this mud world`7) - Sitting in
one room can only accomplish so much good. This section will help you
learn to move about in the world. Learning your surroundings is an
important part of the mud, and it would be useful to take notes on what   
is where. Remember to utilize other players experience in this area
especially. They know where to go, and what is or is not safe.

   `!*`7 "`&N`7" or "`&NORTH`7" - Used to go north. All movements are based off 
   of this.
      
   `!*`7 "`&S`7" or "`&SOUTH`7" - Used to go south.
      
   `!*`7 "`&E`7" or "`&EAST`7" - Used ot go east.
       
   `!*`7 "`&W`7" or "`&WEST`7" - Used to go west.

   `!*`7 "`&U`7" or "`&UP`7" - Used to go up
        
   `!*`7 "`&D`7" or "`&DOWN`7" - Used to go down
        
   `!*`7 "`&LOOK`7" - Shows you everything in the room including room name, 
   room description, items, players and mobiles (non-player mud
   characters). This also allows you to look into containers and
   items and players, which you can get details on by type "`^help  
   look`7".
        
   `!*`7 "`&SCAN`7" - Shows all players and mobiles nearby. Based on how
   close the message says it will tell you how far they are away.
   IE: "Diem is close by to the north." means that Diem is 1 north
   from your current location while "Diem is rather far off to the
   north." means that Diem is 4 north from your current location.
   `@NOTE`2:`7 Scan does not show you anything that is in the same room.
        
   `!*`7 "`&WHERE`7" - Gives the name of the player and the room name they
   are in of the area you are in. IE: If you are in Midgaard and
   type "`^where`7" you will notice that most players show up as being
   at 'The Temple Altar' which is a safe room (a room where players
   and mobiles cannot attack you). By paying attention to room names 
   you can learn the mud a lot quicker, and will help a great deal
   in the long run.

~
-1 EQUIPMENT OBJECT~
`$EQUIPMENT/OBJECT`7 (`4What you are wearing, your equipment`7) - When using
equipment you have to keep in mind where the eq is. Is it lying on the
ground, in your inventory, are you wearing it, is it contained in
something, or does someone else have it?  

   `!*`7 "`&EQ`7" or "`&EQUIPMENT`7" - Shows what eq you are currently wearing
   and what body position it is worn on. You get the benefits of any
   stats that are on the armor including +hit points, mana, armor,
   permanent spells, etc.
        
   `!*`7 "`&INV`7" or "`&INVENTORY`7" - Lists everything you are carrying, but
   not wearing. This means you don't get any of the benefits of the
   equipment that it may have on it.
        
   `!*`7 "`&GET <item>`7" - Picks up items that are on the ground. Typing
   "look" will show you a listing of the items and you can guess the
   name of the item based on its description. Also you can type "`^get
   1.`7" or "`^get 2.`7" to pick it up by the number that it is on the  
   ground. This command can also be taken a step further and you can
   pick up multiple items of a similar name, like "`^get all.sword`7"
   would pick up every item that had the keyword of 'sword'. You can
   also use just "`^get all`7" to get everything that is on the ground
   regardless of keyword. Sometimes you have to get items from
   within containers, which you can get more information about by
   typing "`^help look`7" and "`^help get`7".
        
   `!*`7 "`&DROP <item>`7" - Drops an item that is located in your inventory 
   onto the ground.
        
   `!*`7 "`&GIVE <item> <name>`7" - Allows you move an item from your
   inventory to the inventory of someone else, player or mobile. IE:
   "`^give sword Diem`7" would put the first item with the keyword of
   sword in your inventory into Diem's inventory.

   `!*`7 "`&WEAR <item>`7" - Takes an item that is in your inventory and
   lets you wear it in your equipment listing according to the   
   position that it is designed for. For instance, if you have a
   weapon it will be wielded, and rings will be worn on your finger.
   If you already have an item that you are wearing then it will
   remove that item and put it in your inventory when you wear the
   other item.
        
   `!*`7 "`&REMOVE <item>`7 " - Moves an item that you are wearing in your
   equipment listing to your inventory. This is useful if you don't
   want to wear equipment, or you have body positions where you can
   wear 2 items. A good example of this is if you are wearing 2
   rings on your fingers and have 2 new rings that you want to
   replace it with. You can type "`^rem ring`7" then "`^rem ring`7" again to
   remove the old ones, and then "`^wear <item>`7" and "`^wear <item>`7" to
   wear the new ones.
        
   `!*`7 "`&DONATE <item>`7" - There is a room where all donated equipment
   collects, which is 1 down from healers. You can donate any item  
   that is lying on the ground with this command. This room is a 
   good place to look for spare equipment for your character.
        
   `!*`7 "`&SAC <item>`7" - Destroys the item and removes it from play.
   Depending on the value  of the item you can be awarded gold and
   silver.
        
   `!*`7 "`&EAT <item>`7" - When you're hungry you heal slower, so it's good 
   to keep up your strength. You will eat items from your inventory,
   and you can buy new items from shops ("`^help buy`7").
        
   `!*`7 "`&DRINK <item>`7" - Also you heal slower when you are thirsty. You
   will drink items from your inventory. There are also special  
   drinks too that contain blood. Bloody drinks will satisfy both
   thirst and hunger.

   `@QUAFF`2, `@ZAP`2, `@BRANDISH`2, `@CLOSE`2, `@OPEN`2, `@FILL`2, `@LIST`2, `@BUY`2, `@SELL`2, `@VALUE`7
~
-1 FIGHTING~        
`$FIGHTING`7 (`4How to kill something`7) - Before we tell you where to go and
explain more involved things like leveling you need a basic understanding
of combat. In later sections you can also learn about more commands and
tactics, but for now we'll stick to simplicity.
        
   `!*`7 "`&CONSIDER <name>`7" - Fighting blindly will get you into trouble.
   You can ask other players, 'Should I attack Hassan?' but a better
   way is to find out for yourself. You can accomplish this with
   consider. It will rate based on level how well you might fair
   versus this opponent. If you get a message like, "You can kill   
   Diem naked and weaponless." then you can probably take him, but 
   if you get something like, "Death will thank you for your gift."
   then you should reconsider your actions.
        
   `!*`7 "`&KILL <name>`7" - Puts you into combat with the character. This  
   is the most basic way to enter combat, and you can substitute 
   this command for "`^hit`7". They all do the same thing.
       
   `!*`7 "`&FLEE`7" - When you get in trouble (and you definately will at
   some point) you'll need to get away. Typing flee will remove you
   from combat and send you into a room 1  away. If you have no
   rooms near you, then you won't be able to flee and will need to
   find other means of escape like recall.
        
   `!*`7 "`&RECALL`7" - From level 1-10 you can use this ability to get away
   and bring you back to 'The Temple of Mota'. It is 1 south from
   healers, and is a good way to escape danger from mobiles. On this
   mud we have mob chasing which means that the mobiles do run after
   you if you run away. Keep this in mind when you get into trouble.

~
-1 MUDSCHOOL~
`$MUDSCHOOL `7(`4Where to go and what to kill`4) - This gives you a general
idea of where to start at and what your character needs to do. "`^help
leveling`7" will pull up a list of areas and mobs you can kill from 1-10,
and general idea of direction to head in. This is not a complete list, 
but a general guideline. Other players will know best how to advance your
characters. Also, it will contain skills and spells you should practice,
which is also a guideline. Again utilize players as a resource for 
information.

1) You come in at Mud School Entrance, so I will give directions from
there. If you get lost just type "`^recall`7" and then "`^u`7". Go 1
north and then 1 west. You will see "The Adept of Diem". This will 
put you at a place where you can train.

   `!*`7 `&TRAIN`7 - Trains are used to up your stats like hit  
   points (life energy or HP), and mana (used for casting spells).
   It can also be used to buy skills/spell groups you didn't buy
   when you created your character. "`^help gain`7" for more details.

2) After training you'll need to practice. In order to do this you
must find a place. In Mud School you go 1 north and then 1 east to
"The priest of Asmodeus" where you can practice. If you are at where
you trained, then it would be 2 east.   

   `!*`7 `&PRACTICE`7 - Practices are used for your skills/spells
   and your profiency at using them. Typing "`^practice`7" by itself
   will give you a list of all your skills and spells. You'll probably
   want to practice whatever weapon you chose initially. You'll see 
   something like "dagger              40%". 75% is maximum you can
   attain through practicing. So you will want to get it as close to
   that as possible. To do this you would type "`^practice dagger`7". If
   you want to practice other things you can, but it would be advised
   to ask for help on what is good to focus on initially.

`@NOTE`2:`7 Typing "`^score`7" will show you stats, and you'll notice
you started off with 3 trains and 5 practices.

3) From here you will want to collect equipment. You should be
familiar with reading about manipulating equiment and how to fight,
but now is where we put it to the test. 
 
   `!*`7 From Mud School Entrance you will want to go 1 north, and you
   will notice a backpack on the floor. So "`^get backpack`7" to grab 
   it, "`^open backpack`7" since it's closed, and "`^look in backpack`7"
   to see what's inside. Sometimes you'll see some iron rations so you
   can "`^get ration backpack`7", "`^get all.ration backpack`7", or just
   "`^get all backpack`7". From here you'll need to go 1 north to get 
   the canteen on the floor. To verify you have all this type "`^inv`7".
   In order to eat you would just type "`^eat ration`7" and to drink type
   "`^drink canteen`7".

   `!*`7 Now we move onto getting stuff you can wear. From Mud School
   Entrance you would go 2 north, 1 west, 2 north, 1 west, and 1 down.
   If you type "`^scan`7" you will notice monsters in almost every
   direction. You can pick any direction, and go there. Some of them
   will be aggressive and attack you automatically, but if they don't
   just type "`^kill monster`7". If you notice you get low on hps then
   type "`^flee`7" and you'll be back at "The Adept of Dreyus" who will
   heal your wounds. Once you defeat one of these monsters you'll need
   to get their equipment from them by typing "`^get all corpse`7". Now
   that you have this, you want to put it on. An easy way is just to
   type "`^wear all`", but you can also wear each peice individually. If
   you get stuck just refer to the "`^help movement`7" section of the
   Newbie help file. Now that you've done this, repeat this to each of
   the drections from Dreyus, north, east, south, west.

   `@NOTE`2: If you die you will be put in the "Morgue". To get out of 
   there just type, "`^stand`7". From there you will go 1 up, 1 south,
   and 1 up to get back to Mud School Entrance.

   `!*`7 You should be wearng a decent amount of equipment at this point,
   and if you type "`^score`7" you will notice you have more hps as well.
   A good idea at this point is to sit at "The Adept of Dreyus" and just
   wait for him to heal you back up to full hps. Once there then go 1 down,
   1 east, and 1 north. You will probably notice a small and big creature.
   These are much more difficult than the other monsters you were fighting
   before, so you might have to take advantage of the option to "`^flee`7".
   At this time you will need to keep in mind that some mobs hunt you. This
   means that after you flee they will come after you. So if this happens 
   then run back to "The Adept of Dreyus" which is a safe room, where you 
   cannot be attacked.

   `!*`7 After both creatures are dead you'll notice you have a key in your
   inventory. If you go back 1 south to where you see just a North and West
   exit and type "`^scan`7". You should see "A closed door right here to the
   east." To open this door you can either unlock the direction by typing
   "`^unlock east`7" or the door's name by typing "`^unlock door`7". Now you
   can open it by typing "`^open east`7" or "`^open door`7". Now you'll want
   to go back and heal at Dreyus, but if you feel confident go back 1 east.
   Here you will see a hideous diploma beast which you can defeat for a mud
   school diploma. 

Congradulations!! You have passed Mud School and now you are fully equiped 
and ready to rumble. Watch out Shadows of Time!!
~
-1 LEVELING~
`$LEVELING `7(`4What do you do now?`7) - After going through Mud School you
are ready to start the process of leveling. Everytime you advance a level
you will want to go back to Mud School to practice and train. Directions
from this point on will be given in reference to "Within the Healing Chamber"
(also called healer) which is 1 north from recall or "The Entrance to the
Healing Chamber". This is a safe room you can go to heal up without worries
of being attacked by mobs or players. We will also refer to the creatures you 
fight as "mobs" which is short for "mobiles".

`@NOTE`2:`7 Make sure you see how hard a mob is before you fight it and type
"`^consider <target>`7" to see how difficult a mob is.

1) Now you have to decide which area to go to. There are two major places
for you to level until you hit level 6. You can go 1 south 1 up and south
from healer and kill any of the mobs in the area. But be careful, because
if there is more than 1 mob of the same type (like two lizards) then they
might help each other out and quickly kill you. To counteract this you can
push them out of the room by "`^push <target> <direction>`7" (like "`^push
lizard east`7").

2) Another area you can go to is Darkfriend's Lair which is 3 south, 3 west,
3 south, and east from healer. This area is probably the easier of the two
but runs out of mobs to fight fairly quickly.

3) After reaching level 6 you will notice you don't get very much experience
from these mobs and need to find a new source of destruction. A good place 
to start is Gleeman area or Ratahl. From Pella the healer, you can go to 
Gleeman area by heading 3 south (A Beautiful and Magnificent Square in 
Whitebridge), 28 east along Caemlyn Road, 1 north (Caemlyn Road just past
Four Kings), 13 east (Center Market Square in New Thalos), 11 north 
(Beginning of Fantasy Road), 4 west (Before the Gleeman's Passage), 6 north 
(A Storage Room).

Machael, the Master Gleeman is another safe room/healer. You can also 
practice and train here. Typically from 6-10 you want to kill mouse and
rats you find (rats will be hidden so you would need to ask for a potion of
detection to see them). Also you can go to Ratahl which is 6 south from
Master Gleeman and west. Wandering around there you can fight the black
beetles. As you go up levels you can fight the maids, and other mobs.
Generally you can stay in this area until you hit level 20-25.

4) Whenever you hit level 11 you'll want to try to get a new set of equipment.
To do this you can ask for help or try yourself. Wandering around Whitebridge
(the city you started in) you can look for town watchman. They carry equipment
which is a step up for your initial issue equipment. Be very careful because
these mobs are deadly as well.

Good luck!! This should get you going and in the right direction. Make sure to
use the novice or ooc channels to ask for help. Remember it's a giant learning
process so don't expect to get it right the first time.
~     
-1 INTRODUCTION REMEMBER FORGET~
You walk down the street, and you don't know everyone you see, right? That's
the way it is here as well. You can recognize someone only by their age, 
nationality, and gender. Through roleplaying they can reveal their identity
to you so you know who they are.

`$SYNTAX`4:`7
`&remember <descriptors> <name>`7 - With this command you can associate anyone
you see by their descriptors. For instance if you see "a middle-aged illian man"
you could type "remember illian Diem" or "remember man Diem". Or using a ' you
can us multiple words like "remember 'a middle-aged illian man' Diem". You can
also reassociate a name like "remember Diem SuperDiem".
`&forget <name>`7 - If you mess up on a name and don't want to reassociate you
can just start over by typing this in.
~
-1 AFK~
Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing   
replay.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,
but don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is
turned off.
 
Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs off before
reading them).

Ignorance is no excuse from now on.  If you feel the need to harrass players
while they are afk, then the IMMs will feel the need to punish you just as
quickly. Once again, DO NOT MESS WITH AFK PLAYERS.
~
-1 CASTING WEAVE WEAVING CHANNELING SPELLS SPELLCASTING~
The One Power is a strong power that enables you to take advantage of your half
of the True Source; saidin or saidar. Saidin is the male half, and saidar the
female. It is also seperated into five powers: Fire, Earth, Air, Water, and
Spirit. Different patterns you weave take advantage of different powers on
varying amounts of strength.
    
`$SYNTAX`4:`7
`&weave <spell> <target>`7 OR `&channel <spell> <target>`7
`&spell <none/level/all`7 - List of spells, their level, and mana costs.
`&power # # # # #`7 - Modify your five powers "help powers".
`@NOTE`2:`7 If casting a spell that requires multiple words like detect invis,
then use 'detect invis'. IE: "cast 'detect invis' monster.

Before you weave a spell you must practice it. Also, the <target> is optional.
Many spells which need targets will use an appropriate default target, especially 
during combat. You can also type "spell" for a list of known weaves, or "spell      
all" for a list of all available spells. This also includes the mana costs for      
each spell. 
~
-1 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD ISTAT LSTAT~
Objects can be manipulated in several different ways dependant on where
they are, what they are, and what you want to do with them.

can wear based on your level.

Objects can also use "all" as a modifier or "all.<object>" to wear all objects
that meet that name criteria (IE: "wear all.initial" would wear everything in
your inventory that has "intial" as a keyword).

~
-1 NAME~
`7Although Shadows of Time doesn't require name authorization, we do require
names that fit into the roleplaying theme of the game.  They do not have to 
be strictly Wheel of Time book names, but should at least sound medieval fantasy
based. Please keep this in mind with picking a name, and if you need help take 
advantage of our random name generator by typing either "`&male`7" or "`&female`7" at the
prompt otherwise to create a new name, just type it at the prompt.

`$New Name`4: `7~

-1 CUSTOMIZE WIMPY SHOW BRIEF COMPACT ALIAS TITLE~
There are several diffrent commands available that let you configure what 
you see and your actions in the mud. Each of these will give you a unique
feel on the mud.

`&WIMPY`7    : Sets a level of hit points at which you will attempt to
             flee. Also, sets the level for 'mana shield' spell to wear
             off. "wimpy #" to set the amount.
`&AUTOLIST`7 : Configures a variety of automatic changes like displaying exits,
             looting equipment from corpses, sacrificing corpses, etc. Just
             type "autolist" by itself and then run whichever command you want.

`&ALIAS`7    : Create shortcut keys with this. Just type "alias <keyword>

             set it higher by typing "scroll on" for infinite or "scroll #"
             for a particular number of lines.
~
-1 RESTRING~
Restring is a command to restring an item of your choice with the
description that you like. This is to allow more customization of
your character, and enhance roleplaying in the game. You must have
a `$R`4estring `!C`1oupon`7 in your inventory and the item you wish
to restring.

`$SYNTAX`4:`7
`&restring <item name>  `7- Puts you in restring mode, confiscating both
your coupon as well as the item.

-1 BOOKS STUDY~
There's always more to learn, and things you don't understand. Once you
reach max level and even before, there is much more than just leveling.
One added bonus is Books where you can learn new and unusual skills and
spells.

`$SYNTAX`4:`7
`&quest turnin study`7 - Requires `#A C`&oupon `#of S`&tudy`7  with which you
obtain the study skill so that you can read books.  Without the study skill, 
books will be only so much extra useless baggage.

`&study <book>`7 - Allows you to gain knowledge of the skill contained in the 
pages that you study.

`$TYPES`3:`7
`&A Book of Save Life        `7- help save_life
`&A Book of Scrying          `7- help scry
`&A Book of Taming           `7- help tame
`&A Book of Storekeeping     `7- help storekeeping
`&A Book of Coupling         `7- help couple
`&A Book of Horseback Riding `7- help horseback
`&A Book of Unravel          `7- help unravel
~
-1 SAVE_LIFE 'SAVE LIFE'~
A Book of Save Life grants the ability to syphon half of your current
hit points to any desired target. While severly weakening you it can
mean the difference between life and death for the target.  

`#SYNTAX`4: `&weave/channel 'save_life' <target>`7
~
-1 SCRYING~
Tracking by normal means is slow and sluggish, and somewhat of a guessing
game. Scrying is an ability that gives you clairvoyance to see the room
that the target is in from any distance. An ability like this would 
allow you to see what they were doing, who they were doing it with, and 
more importantly where they are.

`$SYNTAX`4: `&scry <target>`7
~
-1 TAME TAMING~
A steed can be expensive, so why not just find one in the wild? Well
without this skill you would not be able to accomplish this. It does
of course require the skill to actually ride horses.

`$SYNTAX`4: `&tame <target>`7
~
-1 COUPLE COUPLING~
One of the most coveted secrets of the One Power is the ability to use
multiple weaves at once. Those who master this skill have around a 33%
chance of a spell going off in addition to the normal one they cast.
Any spell can be coupled to another provided it is not a direct damage
spell (like combat group, dracs, energy drain, etc). This leaves lots
of room for creativity.

`$SYNTAX`4:`7
`&couple # spell spell`7 - You can coupon # 0-4 where the first spell 
is the trigger spell and the second spell is the coupled spell. (IE:
"couple 0 'dispel magic' 'fear'" would have a chance to cast fera each
and every time you used dispel magic.) 
`&couple show`7          - Shows a list of current spells coupled.
~
-1 HORSEBACK RIDING REIN SPUR MOUNT DISMOUNT GALLOP~
As fast you are on foot, a horse provides you greater speed. Another
advantage of riding a horse is potential for more damage as well as
better defense. However, once your horse dies you must spend a little
bit of time getting back up, and suffering the remainder of damage
which was inflicted on the horse. Horses can be either bought at a 
Pet Store, or found in the wild and tamed through the Book of Taming.

`$SYNTAX`4:`7
`&mount <target>`7 - Once you have a horse following you, all you have
to do is to mount it.
`&dismount`7       - When you are through riding your horse then just
jump off and discharge it if you need to.
`&spur`7           - One of the greatest benefits of a horse is the
ability of it to gallop. While spurred a horse moves 2 rooms at a 
time instead of the normal 1 (like you do. You cannot gallop if 
there is only 1 room to a wall, so you need the full 2 spaces.
`&rein`7           - Reining a horse will stop it's gallop and
restore normal pace of 1 room per move used.
~
-1 UNRAVEL~
What can be done, can also be undone. The One Power can be used in this
instance to unravel the weaves of another spell. It can only be used on
portals/gates and personal spells, but not on spells cast on others.

`$SYNTAX`4:`7
`&weave unravel <spell>`7 - Unweaves a spell cast on you personally.
`&weave unravel portal`7  - Unweaves a target portal.
~
-1 QUESTMASTER QUESTING QP QUESTPOINTS 'QUEST POINTS' QUEST_POINTS TURNIN TOKEN~
There are two basic types of quests in the game; questmaster or immortal
run quests. Questmaster quests are automated and require no intereaction
from the immortals. Immortal run quests are special events taking place
at the whim of the staff, and offer greater rewards than normally
avialable to players. Immortal quests are typically announced through
the note boards, but can be sporatic as well. Below we will be discussing
the QuestMaster and the nuances involved with using him.

`$SYNTAX`4:`7
`&quest                 `7- Shows a list of most of the possible commands.
`&quest points          `7- Displays your total quest points earned.
`&quest info            `7- If you have forgetten the details of the quest you
are in this will fill you in.
`&quest time            `7- Indicates how long you have remaining on a quest
if you are on one, or the time remaining until you can quest again.
`&quest request         `7- Requests a quest.
`&quest complete        `7- Completes a quest if you have obtained the 
proper requirements for finishing.
`&quest list            `7- A list of available items the QuestMaster sell
and their related prices.
`&quest buy <item>      `7- Buy an item on the quest list.
`&quest buy token #     `7- Withdraw an amount of quest points with a 10%
fee deducted at creation of token.
`&quest turnin <type>   `7- Redeem prize coupon, a token, rename, or restore.
`&quest abort           `7- Quit a quest you can't complete.
`&quest answer <answer> `7- Complete a riddle quest with the answer.

`@Quest Types`2:`7
`&Hack 'n slash `7- Find the mob, kill it, and that's it.
`&Retrieval     `7- Based on the hints avialable, try to track down
the items location, and give it back to QM.
`&Rescue        `7- A mob's in trouble, and you have to kill the
attacker before they killt he mob.
`&Riddle        `7- The most difficult of quests, perhaps because you
have to actually think about this one. It also gives the best of
all rewards.
~
-1 CLASS ARCHER ASSASSIN CLERIC FORM_MASTER 'FORM MASTER' ILLUMINATOR MAGE ROGUE WARRIOR~
This is a brief description of each class and particular commands which
could be helpful in learning them.

`&ARCHER      `7- While not strong at close combat, they have a particular
ability to fire arrows up to 8 rooms. As far as classes go they are one
of the more difficult. 
`&ASSASSIN    `7- Stealthy and deadly are two words synonmous with this 
class. Their deadly art allows them to make up for less combat abilities
than warriors by dealing massive amounts of damage quickly, and
outlasting their opponents.
`&CLERIC      `7- Curative powers are never to be underestimated. With healing
ability comes deadly powers as well. They defeat their enemies by remaining
ever vigilant and healing themselves.
`&FORM MASTER `7- Almost completely not orientated with the True Source, they
have made it up with an arsenal of deadly attacks.
`&ILLUMINATOR `7- Closely guarded is the deadly art of making bombs, and an
Illuminator remains alive not by their ability to do damage. Instead they
rely on their bombs and personal powers at avoiding damage. There are many
bomb types that allow them to vary their styles.
`&MAGE        `7- Extremely weak when it comes to physical combat, there is a
tremedous storm that rages within. It burns with the One Power, and permits
them awesome use of this ability.
`&ROGUE       `7- Thievery is an artform. While prefering to stay out of combat,
they still manage to come out with a hefty profit.
`&WARRIOR     `7- Straight weapon damage is what they rely on. No fancy tricks,
or weaving of spells. They just do damage.
~
-1 VOTE VOTING~
Even though this is not a democracy we still want to know how you feel
about issues that concern you. Keep in mind that just because an item is
being voted on it doesn't mean it will happen. So if the topic is "Should
we PWIPE?", don't freak out. Just take it in stride, vote how you feel,
and realize we are educated and concern with how the players feel.

`$SYNTAX`4:`7
`&vote show`7             - Displays the current vote and it's %s.
`&vote for <reason>`7     - Vote for a topic. If you leave off your reason
then you still vote for it. The reason is to tell us why you agree.
`&vote against <reason>`7 - Vote against a topic. Same as for, the reason
just allows us to know why you disagree with it.

`@NOTE`2: You can also tell us what other possibilities we should be
considering. Maybe a variation of the current topic would be better.
~
-1 BONUS_TIME 'BONUS TIME' MINUS_TIME 'MINUS TIME' BONUS2X BONUS3X~
Bonus time is the greatest thing in the world; this world at least. It can
come in several shapes and varieties, but it's an experience multiplier. What
this means is that during bonus time you will get more experience than normal.
For instance, if it was 2x bonus time then that means if you would have gotten
1000XP for a kill you would get 2000XP instead. Great?! Bonus time can be
achieved by buying it through "roleprize", "gameinfo", or generally given by
an immortal. Be wary though, asking for bonus time can sometimes get you 
minus time, which is an experience reducer! Bonus time comes in the 2x, 3x,
4x, and the seldom seen but always desired 5x types.
~
-1 GAMEINFO GAME_INFO 'GAME INFO'~
Who says we never give you anything for free? This is a rotating counter
that functions off of mobile deaths. Everytime a mob dies it counts down
1 on the counter. When one of the counters reaches 0, the effect goes off,
and it's reset again.

`$SYNTAX`4: `&gameinfo`7

`@Gameinfo Types`2:`7
Armor Bonus!     - Weaves the spell armor on you as a level 80.
Shield Bonus!    - Weaves the spell shield on you as a level 80.
Bless Bonus!     - Weaves the spell bless on you as a level 80.
Sanctuary Bonus! - Weaves the spell sanctuary on you as a level 80.
Restore Bonus!   - Restores you to maximum hps/mana/move, and removes
any unwanted spells.
Bonus Time!      - 2x experience multiplier. "help bonus"
Quest Reset!     - Resets the list of items at Questmaster "help quest".
~
-1 ROLEPRIZE RPPOINTS~
Roleprize can be done through the healer in Midgaard. It serves two
purposes; rppoints and legends. You can use your rppoints to purchase
any number of things, or you can use it to go legend (or for most of
us see how far you are away).

`$SYNTAX`4:`7
`&roleprize legend     - Become a level 76 legend if you meet the standards.
`&roleprize list       - Get a list of what you can buy and for how much.
`&roleprize buy <item> - Actually purchase something on the list.
~
-1 RESTORE~
Whether granted by an immortal, automatic from a level, or part of 
gameinfo this can change the dynamic of everything. Lets just hope 
it happens at the right times for you. This will completely restore
your hit points, mana, and movement to maximum capacity. As well as
remove any unwanted spells such as plague, poison, blindness, or any
other ailments.
~
-1 STRENGTH INTELLIGENCE WISDOM DEXTERITY CONSTITUTION ATTRIBUTES~
Attributes are the defining characteristics of your players abilities.
They distinguish your abilities. Each character will have their own 
strengths and weaknesses.

`@Attribute Types`2:`7
`&Strength`7     - This affects how hard you hit, how much you can hold,
and any number of strength related skills. Also it affects the maximum
weight of the weapon you can wield.
`&Intelligence`7 - How smart are you? Each level you gain, the mana you
are awarded is partially determined by your level of intelligence. This
also affects how quickly you learn new skills and spells.
`&Wisdom`7       - How many licks does it take to get to the center of a
tootsie(TM) roll pop? The Wise Owl knew, and he just ate it. This clever
attribute affects how many practice sessions you get each level.
`&Dexterity`7    - Stick and move. Move like a butterfly, sting like a
bee. Well the sting is strength, but the moving is pure dex. Dexterity
is your aptitude for movement. It affects your ability to dodge, parry,
evade, or any number of defensive abilities. It also affects your armor
class, and how much movement you get per level.
`&Constitution`7 - Kick me in the jimmy! This entirely affects how many
hit points you get per level. Each statistic is vital, as is this one.
~
-1 'RP LEVEL' RPEXP 'RP EXP' RPLEVEL RPEXPERIENCE RPPOINTS~
Roleplaying is a tremedous part of the mud, and we like to reward you for
the rping you do do. In this, "says" and "emotes" give you rpexp. When you
accumulate enough rpexp you advance an rplevel. Each rplevel gives you a
few hps, mana, movement, a practice, and a rppoint. These rppoints can be
redeemed at the healer in Midgaard using the "roleprize" command. Keep in 
mind that says and emotes are logged, and there is anti-abuse code in
place. So please use it respectfully. You can view your current rplevel,
rpexp, and rppoints through "score".

`@NOTE`2:`7 RPpoints can also be awarded by imms for extremely well done
roleplay.
~
-1 PRACTICE SKILLS~
The aptitude you have with a skill or spell is determined by the percentage
you have with it. The higher the proficency the more successfully you can use
it, and with some skills once you reach 100% you get added bonuses. With
practice sessions you acquire through various means you can practice it up
to 75%. However, you don't always want to practice it exactly to 75%. If you
practiced it and were at 72% then it would be a waste to use another practice
to raise it only 3%, so take it as an educated decision.

`$PRACTICE`4:`7
`&practice               `7- A full list of your skills and spells with %.
`&practice <skill/spell> `7- Practice an individual skill/spell.
`&skills                 `7- List of skills, their %, and level you obtain it.

`@NOTE`2: `7If you are practicing a skill or spell with multiple words you can
use a ' to use more than one word. A good example would be if you have detect
invis and detect hidden, and when you type "practice detect hidden" it would
practice detect invis. "practice 'detect hidden'" would be the proper way.
~
-1 TRAIN~
Besides being able to practice your skills and spells, there is another
somewhat more powerful ability to increase your own body. It can be done
by either increasing your vitality (hit points) or the power which you
can hold of the One Power before exhaustion (mana). New skills and groups
of spells can also be obtained through the "`^gain`7" command.

`$SYNTAX`4:`7
`&train hp`7   - Adds 10 hps to your total vitality.
`&train mana`7 - Adds 10 mana to your total One Power held.
~
-1 COINS EXCHANGE OTHO GOLD SILVER BANK DEPOSIT BALANCE WITHDRAW~
Money is the driving force in life. With it you can afford just about anything.
In this world, along with quest points, gold and silver is the monetary system
of choice.

`@Conversion`2:`7
`&silver`7 - 1 silver = 1/100 gold
`&gold`7   - 1 gold   = 100 silver

`@Exchanging`2:`7
`&give <amount> <type> <exchanger>`7 - When you find a gold exchanger, then you
give them the amount of gold and they give you back the other type minus a small
fee. Otho is a good example of one, who is located in Midgaard. He can be reached
3 south, 3 west, 2 north, 2 east, and 1 south from healer. (IE: "`^give 1000 silver
otho`7", he would return 9 gold and some silver.

`@Banking`2:`7
`&balance`7                  - Current total despoited gold and silver.
`&deposit <amount> <type>`7  - Add more to your total balance.
`&withdraw <amount> <type>`7 - Remove some gold or silver from your balance.
~
-1 DONATE DONATION SACRIFICE~
What do you do when you no longer with to keep a peice of equipment? Well you have
two choices; donation or sacrifice. Sacrificing an item will basically melt it down
to it's most basic elements and give you a partial amount of the value in gold and
silver. The other option is to donate the equipment to the donation room in Midgaard,
which is located 1 down from healer.

`$SYNTAX`4:`7
`&donate <item>`7    - Donates a peice of equipment to Donation Room.
`&sacrifice <item>`7 - Remove the equipment from the game and get a little gold.
~
-1 'FIVE POWERS' POWERS FIRE EARTH AIR WATER SPIRIT 'TRUE SOURCE' TRUESOURCE TRUE_SOURCE ONEPOWER 'ONE POWER' ONE_POWER SAIDIN SAIDAR~
The True Source is the driving force behind "magic" in the Wheel of Time. It is divided
into two halves; saidin and saidar. Saidin is the male half, and saidar is the female.
It is further broken down into five powers; fire, earth, air, water, and spirit. Any
channeling you do is done through use of a single power or a complex weave of several
powers. So by altering your strengths in powers you will find some of your abilities
will be stronger than others. The higher the power the higher the level at which you
have the ability to use at.

`$SYNTAX`4:`7
`&power <fire> <earth> <air> <water> <spirit>`7 - You can affect each power by a range
of 1-3, but with a total of 10 points to divide among all of them. So you could choose
the default which is "`^power 2 2 2 2 2`7" or vary it any way you wish like "`^power 1
2 3 1 2".
~
-1 DELETE~
No, don't do it!! What a world, what a world. Everybody else is staying, why don't you?
Don't be weak! You wuss, sure take the easy way out.

`$SYNTAX`4:`7
`&delete`7 - Type it once you're ok, but type it twice and you're not so .. ok .. or
anything else for that matter. Hey wait, you're not matter either!
~
-1 ISPELL~
This skill helps you with the hardest part of playing this game; proper spelling. It
contains a dictionary of words that can be used to obtain proper spelling of most
words.

`$SYNTAX`4: `&ispell <word>`7
~
-1 COPYOVER~
This is like a warmboot. It reloads the mud without inconveniencing the players.
The process is done as opposed to shutting down the mud, and then booting it back
up again. Cold boots like that severe your connection and force you to reconnect.
~
-1 TAG~
Tag is a flag that is passed around by everyone who joins. This can only be started
by an immortal, and the flag is passed when you die to the person who kills you.
~
-1 CRIMINAL MURDER~
In place of a simple Out-of-Level punishment system, we have adopted a more complex
Criminal/Murder system. This can be awarded by Guide or added under very specific
conditions, such as stealing from someone out of range or killing them.

The criminal flag is a 300 tick flag that prevents you from being safe, and when
you die you don't lose anything. If you advance to a murder flag then you have
to endure the same 300 tick counter, but if you are killed you lose 10% off of
all of your skills and spells.
~
-1 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual  
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~
-1 ORDER GROUP GTELL FOLLOW DISCHARGE~
You can form alliances with someone and become a group rather just have to
be individuals. Once grouped you share experience earned from killing, and
using some of the auto flags such as autoassist and autosplit you can take
advantage of grouping. If you joins someone's group then you will follow
them, but you cannot follow if they have "nofollow" turned on.

`$SYNTAX`4:`7
beckon <name>        - Social to indicate to someone who wish them to follow.
follow <name>        - Follow someone's movements (Required for grouping).
group <name>         - Toggle joining/removing someone from your group.
group                - Display statistics on all group members.
gtell <message>      - Send a message to everyone who is in your group.
nofollow             - Toggle ability of others to follow you. If others are
following you and you turn following off, then they will be ungrouped.
order <who> <action> - Order a mob to take an action (IE: "`^order all flee`7")
discharge <name>     - Ungroup a mob and remove it from the game.
~
-1 REST SLEEP STAND SIT WAKE~
There are varied positions which affect your ability to perceive the world
you are in, movement, and rate at which you recover health and power. 

`$POSITIONS`4:`7
`&stand`7 - Position of moving, slowest heal rate.
`&rest`7  - Resting position increases health rate but still allows you to
see all activity within the room you are in.
`&sit`7   - Similar to resting you can see activity in the room you are in.
`&sleep`7 - Fastest healing rate, you are more vulnerable to attacks and 
cannot see anything in the room you are in.
`&wake`7  - Wake from sleeping position, stand also works.
~
-1 WHO WHOIS~

~
-1 PREMISE CP 'CREATION POINTS' CREATIONPOINTS CREATION_POINTS EXPERIENCE~
Each skill/group has an associated value to it. As you accumulate more CP
(creation points) the experience per level required increases. On average
an easy character is anywhere below 10,000XP per level. Medium characters
range up to 20,000XP, and above that is reserved for more advanced players.
When you die you lose a % of your XP to level, so if you have less per each
level then you loose less when you die.

Skills are non-channeling orientated abilities, usually having to do with
physical actions like combat. Groups are weaves (spells) that are related
to each other by a general theme.

The default for the class is a good solid base character which has all the
necessities, but none of the frills. So, typing "`^add <class> default`7"
like assassin would add everything in the group. This can also assist in
speedier character creation.
~
-1 'MENU CHOICE'~
`$Select `4(`&add`7,`&drop`7,`&list`7,`&help`4) `7- ~
-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~

`&alias <word> <subtitution> `7- Substitute a word for another command.
`&unalias <word>             `7- Remove an alias.

`$EXAMPLE`4:`7
`&alias gc get all corpse  - Typing "gc" will equal typing "get all corpse".  
`&alias po weave 'portal'  - "po mob" will equal "weave 'portal' mob".
`&alias say osay           - "say <message>" would do "osay <message>".
`&alias ic say             - "ic <message>" would do "say <message>". Since
ic aliased to say and say is aliased to osay then ic would not osay. They do
not continual on to be relational to each other.

-1 ARAFEL~
"The dancing is sweeter on the edge of a sword." -Arafel saying

Arafel is a nation as any other nation of the borderlands; strong in military
tradition. The nation is located west of Shienar and is made up of more rugged
country than Shienar. The Roses, a red rose and a white rose is their sigil,
and their flag is 3 red roses on the lest and 3 white rises on the right, on a
field of red and white quarters.

The men are easily recognized by their distinctive hairstyle. Wearing their
hair in two long braids, they adorn the ends of each usually with silver bells.
On their backs they wear two swords, one over each shoulder. Most natives are
marked by their large eyes and pale skin.

The current ruler is King Paitar Nachiman, who's sister is Kiruna Sedai of the

-1 SEANCHAN~
Though the land is nearly three thousand leagues across the Aryth Ocean, the
people of the Seanchan must, in the light of recent events, be taken seriously.
Before Artur Hawkwing sent his son Luthair and his armies across the ocean, the
Seanchan as a constantly shifting quilt of nations of various sizes, ruled by
Aes Sedai. Everyone was for themselves, all scheming and plotting for their own
advancement. Indeed assasination was the most common cause of death among even
the Aes Sedai. Luthair's hatred for Aes Sedai eventually lead them to be sought
for enslavement.

The lowest class in Seanchan is the da'covale, or "those who are property," or
simply covale, "property." Merchants and commoners rank just above lowly slaves,
but many upper-class slaves, such as the so'jhin, the heriditary upper servants
of the Blood, outrank free men and women.

Appearances and etiquette are supremely importantly to the Seanchan, and physical
manifestation of rank are essential. Members of the Blood shave their head,
leaving a crest of hair on top that often flows down the back. A Voice of the
Blood will wear the left side of the head shaved and the right side braided. A
voice of the Throne will shave the right side and leave the left side braided.
Members of the Imperial Family shave their head completely. Commoners shave
their head completely. 

Both the Tower of Ravens and the Court of the Nine Moons are located in Seandar,
the Imperial capital, located in the northeast of the Seanchan continent. Seandar
is the largest city in the Empire. The other major cities in descending order of
size are: Kirendad, Noren M'Shar, Asinbayar, Qirat, Imfaral, Sohima, T'zura,
Anangore, Shon Kifar, and Rampore.

They are lead by the Council of the Nine Moons, from the Crystal Throne. The
imperial sigil is a gloden hawk in flight, clutching three lightning bolts in
its claws. The banner is a wide border of royal blue around a white box inside
which a golden hawk in flight clutches three lightning bolts in its claws.

-1 ENHANCED_CHAR FORSAKEN DRAGON RAND~
An enhanced character such as Rand or the Forsaken is both a great
privilege and a responsibility.  As an enhanced character you are
expected to be an example not in only roleplay, but in all facets
of playing.  Meaning that you are expected to follow all rules and
be respective of other mudders.  This is not to say that you can't
rp the dark ways of a Forsaken, but there is also a line between
rping a forsaken and badgering someone till the game is no longer
fun for them.  Basically just remember that as an enhanced character
people look to you somewhat like they do the immortal staff as a
representative of what the mud is, so you're working to make the
mud look good.

Guidelines:
1)  Must not have a GL character (Both an Enhanced char and a GL char
	require that to be your primary character and you obviously
	can't have two primary characters)
2)  Must have at least one level 75 character currently
3)  Enhanced characters cannot participate in tournaments
4)  Enhanced characters should limit OOC conversation you should be
        focused on rping at all times.
5)  Must have good RP for every PK.  This is a rule for all, but 
	especially important for an enhanced character.

If you wish to apply for one of these spots and they have recently
been announced as having an open spot please see:
help "enhanced_app"
~

-1 ENHANCED_APP DRAGON_APP FORSAKEN_APP~
With all the points mentioned in "help enhanced_char" in order to apply
you must write a note to the implementors (i.e. note to IMP) that 
describes you and what you would like to do with the character.  There 
is no length requirement,  but the more compelling of a note you write 
the more likely you are to get what you achieve.  The note should basically 
be a description of the character you wish to play and a brief description 
of the RP path you'd like to take with them.  Also some ideas you had on 
improving the guild that you are aligned with both for RP and for fun.  
These should be things you can do on your own, not code or policy changes 
that you'd like us to make on your behalf.  All followed by your mudders 
resume.  Who you are, some of your alts that we would know, how long you've 
mudded so on.

The following things must be included in your resume:
1) A short list of recognizable alts
2) Any GL spots you've held at SoT
3) How long you've mudded
4) How many hours you think you can put in on a character per week 
	(Be accurate if you lie it will soon be apparent)
