**FORWARD - Original note by Kudzu**

The `#C<`7 in my title will be there until his mud is not allowing me to
play here anymore or until our soldiers come home.  Which ever comes
first...  Because recently we have had a member of our guild be called up
who is going over.  I know some of you may or may not agree with the
stiuation we are in with Iraq, however, that is not a reason to support our
armed servie people over there and care for their safety.  We recently had
Simock join our guild and he has followed the rules and noted me of his
absence he was called up this past week and is going over.  So I do this out
of respect for him and all the others who are called to duty.  This is
personal to me because my father was there the first time around with the
101st through Desert Shield and Desert Storm...  Yes I'm an army brat... 
That is where I get my anal tendancies.  Anyhow, I encourage you all to put
the same in your title to show your concern too for everyone involved in the
war...  Not just our people but the innnocent people over there as well. 
Thanks!

Heyas,
 
I was talking to Logain about the website and he was wanting to get the help
files as part of it.  I know you guys are easily capable of doing this, but I was
wondering if I could come back on to do some minor coding stuff like that.  I don't
have a bunch of time, so it may not be worth it for you guys, but I kinda miss
the coding and if I could do a few little things to help out I think it would
be fun.

Well...  It has come to me from a good source, that if actions are taken

at hacking SOT from a member of that household.  And this comes from the
mouth of Lina (but not told to me by her) who is Melfina, a member of that
house.  I don't know that the particular roommate that would supposedly hack
us muds here, but they've made it apparent in threats that they will do what
they can to bring us down.  Now, the only one I forsee that needs strict
punishment, is Sebastian/Rand...  Possibly even slay/sac.  Jeral just needs
to be silenced, as well as Sammael, which has already been done to both, and
then the actions of Traym need to be delt with.  I dunno what to do for him,

or a member of your guild to make a website if you want one on the page.  If
not, your page wont be linked. Also, 1st and 2nd place prizes may be awarded
but thats up to Dreyus..Here are some of the things that should be included:

-A picture pertaining to your guild of some sort on the homepage,
-A background or description of your guild (could be IC or OOC)
-Guild skills and descriptions for them
-Guild ranks, and descriptions for them
-Anything else you feel that should be interested

Please do not include the current list of members, or the current names
of GL or CoGL as those may be changed at any time and I wouldn't be able
to access it to change it.

P.S. You can send the links to webmaster@shadowsoftime.com or note them

not sure if it could be done, but.. something that's weilded, that doesn't register as weilded, just gets looked at to trans mebbe a slight dam mod, plus any flags..

Well, just as an update, I want you all to be aware that things are NOT
settled as of yet.  But some of you may see the players in question playing
on the mud still, and interacting with players.  Now, as general
information, those players still do not have their channel privledges. 
Also, those players are to really have no interaction with other players
aside from roleplaying and tells, because they are enhanced.  Also, if you
have any trouble with those people, out of character, please let both Dreyus
and myself know immediatly so the situation may be delt with.  If you start
the 'problem' yourself, do not expect them to be punished, but likely you
will earn it for yourself.  If there are any questions, please get ahold of
Dreyus or myself

I dont know much, but I feel Aginor was mad and completely out of his

with Faginor and other shit.  I dont know whatsup with that Imm, Trayme?  Or
something like that, but he did pull Aginor aside while what he should of
done was take them all.  Aginor was wrong and ignorant for posting all them

I think that Rahnne needs commendation beyond what simple little me can give, because she followed me around,
during an exp bonus when she could have been rp leveling, giving me free healing and spellups along the way.
I almost feel as good with Rahnne backing me as I did when Arianna did...
From the bottom of my heart, Thanks.

Tmpl=story2&cid=574&e=2&u=/nm/20030328/wl_nm/iraq_usa_warnings_dc_1 Rumsfeld
also issued sharp warning to another neighboring country, Iran, alleging the
presence inside Iraq of "hundreds" of armed Iraqi Shiite Muslim forces
opposed to the government of Saddam Hussein who are trained and financed by
the Iranians.  Buring a Pentagon brieding, Rumsfeld said U.  S.  Forces
would consider these members of the Badr Brigade as "combatants," although
he said they have "not yet" been hostile toward the U.  S.  -led invasion
force.  Rumsfeld said that "We don't want neighboring countries or anyone
else for that matter to be there assisting the Iraqi forces."  Refering to
members of the Badr Brigade, Rumsfeld noted that they are Iraqis, not
Iranians, and they have been hostile to the current Iraqi government.  Now
my question is this, why would we have a single problem with armed Iraqis
opposed to the Hussein government?  Apparently only those people willing to
blow papa bush off will have a place in the new Iraq.

Over the two and one half years the staff at Shadows of Time have been

THREE chances, but even sometimes as many as SIX chances to clean up thier
acts and return as a normal player with a clean slate.  Many of these
individuals have shown little to no improvement over the past years.  

Some will say that these players influenced the game in a positive way, and by no
means am I saying they did not. However there comes a time when as the administrator
of this game, I need to weight the positive versus the negative influences of these
players both on the playability of the game, and the other players who are
present.

With all things said and done, and when it was put to an IMP decision we have
agreed that this is the final and last option available to us that we
can excercise.

A permanant ban is being placed on the following players, along with that ban
carries the following stipulation: Computer trespassing is defined as accessing a
server or information on a server without permission of the owner. Any player attempting
to connect to this game via a differnt ISP, INCLUDING a friend's computer who is
and knows they have a site of thier banned, will have thier ISP immediately contacted
as how has been done in the past. Time stamped logs will be provided to the

You should log the IP addresses of who creates new characters. Then you newbielock
all the offending sites of the banned players. If you see a banned player playing
a character, then newbielock the site that created the new character. Eventually,
they won't be able to find players to create players for them, and they'll go away.

This would still allow players from the same host to play. They would just need IMM

restricted to one account.  I hate to loose a productive member beacuse his
fuck head childish friends accosiate him with their sespool mentanality. 
He's been makeing huge improvements by leeps and bounds.  I also belive
restricting his logging from his one IP will keep the rest of them away and
banned.  Maybe this mud isnt able to do such sergical restrictions, I dont

Text
Okay guys, time has come to talk about our ban on WT.  Brakar has stated that
the WTs are getting RK before kills without the protection of the treaty, meaning
others can jump them without RK.  So, the question is this...:

Do we want to wait until they're back in the treaty, or should we lift the ban
now?

I will not regulate prices/fees for fixing, that's your own buisness.

Characters are to be removed?  Its dissapointing that Telamose and
Tallonvor were among these, as they were newbies who had only recently
started playing.  Tallonvor had even managed to land a co-GL spot in RH, and
to my knowledge, I dont believe telamose has ever done ANY thing at all.  I
know you wrote in clarification, but is that just an apology?  Telamose
actually stopped by my work today to ask me and tallonvor why he couldn't
log.  While I understand the administration feels they had to go to these
measures to protect the MUD, as is their right as the owners, it seems
dissapointing to me that some names were tacked onto the list simply because
we loged from a particular house.  In fact, if I'd checked my notes on at
their house the other day, it seems like I wouldnt even ba able to log to
point this out.  Once again, I understand, but I was responsible for getting
Telamose to MUD here, mostly after bugging him for over a year ago (once Id
learned he'd read WoT), and trying to get him started ever sence.  


In any case, a dissapointing turn of events and I personally feel was handled in
a haphazard and lazy manner.

And Im still playing.

I feel the ban should have been lifted long ago.  WT has been targets
because they made the first move on moving out of treaty, but I dont keep
tabs on everyone's PK.  It could be no one follows treaty very much, if at
all.  Also, Every guild was given the choice to treaty, and WT shortly after
decided to back out.  It was their decision, and if the treaty had been
self-sustaining there wouldnt be a need for us to impose any further
punishment.  And, it seems to me, that it not our right to judge who gets to
PK whom as we are the non-PK advocates anyway.  Let PKers handle themselves.

I say let the ban stand.. not because of the players in it, but
because the ban was a reaction to the fact that they pulled
out of the treaty and wasn't an action against the players
themselves. Let it stand until the original reason for the ban
is extinguished and the the GL's of WT are officially back in.

This is mainly cuz there would punnishment for breeching the
bounds of the treaty and our punnishment to them would not
be necessary.

I have learned in the last half hour of a few things that have happened

with me he would never had been reguilded for a 3rd time into rh if he told
me this simple fact...  Instead he lied to me.  As for Telamose I'm glad
that you reinstated him he is new and has not been a problem at all in fact
he has been a model guild member in rh.  As for Tallnovor I do not know how
well he can be influenced by seb, koren, and lina but I feel that if he can
honestly log form an differnt ip and not fall into jeopardy of his friends
using him for themselves.  I would like to petition to have him
reinsatted...  He was new also just liek Telamose.  And though I had only

Being an implementor who doesnt track who is who on a daily basis I have
very big problems when it comes to alts of players.  I know there were only
4 players living in the house and we were only trying to target 2 of them. 
This left us with the decision because they all play from the EXACT SAME
network, that it had to be ALL of them or NONE of them.  That had been a
decision we had been pondering for quite some time.  The staff simply felt
the time had come that we should cut the losses we are constantly seeing and
move on.  Yes, this cost us 4 regularily playing mortals, but in the long
run it will gain us much.  


I am sorry if you do not feel this was handled properly, however if half the
time you login from home, and half the time you login from your best friend's
house, how am I supposed to know who is who? Its simply just not possible.

Once again, Lina, Sebastian, Tallonvor, Koren are the only main alts that
are still under the ban.

"Not naming any names at all, but I feel the ban on these 4 players was;moronic and hypocritical."

"Sebastian and Koren;have caused problems here, yes, but who the fuck hasn't?"
- 94% of the pbase.
"You started to ban;Aragorn because you thought he had an attitude problem?"
- Attitude problem and abusing new players are very differnt things.
"...most successful, guild in the history of Shadows of Time."
- As I stated, yes they have done some excellent things, however this does not excuse cheating.
"...overshadowed by just a few fuckups."
- 10 combined fuckups > "a few"
"Koren created a lowbie weapon that loaded in Lugard for a week..."
- Actually, he created the item, loaded one, deleted the reset, moved it to his mortal.
- Please note this "lowbie item" had legend quest stats.
"...how many people truly like Diem?"
- You were obviously never exposed to AoL, nor do you know what this mud is founded on.

I wonder how exactly the police obtained this information off the school

Control of a city will be gained by placing an artifact on an altar,
that artifact must stay there for 48 hours, if it is ever removed for
more than 1 hour, the counter resets. If it is kept for 48 hours constant
town ownership is granted to that guild. A guild can control EVERY area.
Once a guild controls every area, the age will pass, and the world
will reset. Everything but player stats and a few other things
will be wiped clean. Please note this could take a VERY long time
to accomplish. An average age will take 2-4 months to play.

With the emphasis on guilds, I belive we should put careful concideration
to non-guilded players as well.  Yes I do belive it should be benefital to
be guilded but I also belive there should be some bonus to being non-guilded
too.  Some of the bonus' I have thought of are A) Faster healing (as is now)
B) Cheaper to buy stuff (as is now) C) The ability to obtain a merchant
status (Move around areas some what freely under the pretence of selling
goods ala door to door so to speak).  D) Add in some sort of explorer bonus.
Also lets do away with the free pk on non guilded people.  

I have also come up with an idea on rp rule to pk. Make rp to pk guild vs. guild 
easyer to do (less requirements) than rp to pk non guilded folk (more requirements 
since they are not affiliated with anyone guild unless it is knowen that person helps
out that guild or guilds, than they would be concidered a friend of that guild and thus
subject to the same rp guidelines as if they were guilded to that guild.

Money is a issue here. We all know we need it to buy potions and stuff to heal 
and what not.  Why not also have standard eq load in shops instead of haveing it
all load on mobs.  My idea is to strip most mobs of all eq and haveing that eq load
in special shops, avaible for n ammount of gold. Leave some eq (keys and maybe some 
wearable eq) on mobs (tough mobs at that).  Killing mobs to get coin is a good idea
but lets lower the ammount of coin they reward the player. Instead of droping gold and
silver, lets just make them drop silver coins with a few droping both gold and silver.
Haveing the mobs drop silver will make the players work harder to buy better eq and what not.
Also advanced quests can drop more gold as on a one time play basis (currently in place).
There are other ways of getting money too. I just dont have enough space to
put them in this note.  More to come later.

About the Economy and Commerce of the Mud, in addition to Allen's ideas:

Maybe there should be professions along with what class and race and guild you are.  Basically,
I have categorized the professions as follows:

1) Shopkeepers - Standard..Players Selling Equipment, make it so that Shopkeepers who
possess quite a bit of intelligence when gambling and bargaining at prices, can buy items
from other stores at a cheaper price, makes sense, simple logic.

2) Assassins - Self-explanatory..Kill people for money, what more can I say?

3) Musicians - Possess musical talents, and can play instruments and heal people..for money

4) Bank Clerks - These people..should be NOLOOT players, and are basically like walking banks
they can serve as bankers, and basically hold other peoples money and have a way or command of
sorting who's money is owned by who, accordingly and nicely organized way.


5) Messengers - Basically transfer notes back and forth between players or areas for NPCS
and PCs, for gold.


These are just a few professions I thought of..more will come as I think more..please feel
free to give me feedback, thanks.

Alrighty, let's try to think about this the way I saw it.  I'm sitting
in my wagon, minding my own business, and the door opens.  In walks a fellow
I know IC is a warder.  Aragorn then proceeds to set up a thoughtless attack
on a harmless dog, belonging to my wagons.  No apparent reason.  I rush to
the scene and promptly save the dog's life.  Who the hell wouldn't?  It's my
own dog, protecting the Tinker secrets,.  Aragorn is not OOL, we are the
same.  He was not leveling off this mob.  His sole purpose was to trespass
and gain entry through shady means.  Not very warderly.  I did not raise my
hand to him, and he said not a word to me about why he would be there doing
what he was doing.  I submit that in the past, shadow has spelled up mobs to
prevent entry to their keeps and no complaint was made from MAERIC.  I
sumbit that the only reason this is a problem is that he can't simply kill
those spelling up the guild mob.  I further submit that the petty reason for
his wanting to get in OUR area is simply so that he can claim he has a key
to every guild area.  I see no reason why Tinker should allow other players
on the mud to step all over us simply because we can't defend ourselves. 
Lastly, I say that my actions in no way would have contributed to his death,
but only to the DOG's life.  Aragorn had the option of fleeing, while the
dog doesn't.  A guide and staff, you have the option of weighing JUDGEMENT
against concrete rules, and in this situation, I believe you can see that
there is a definite difference between spelling up players in pk, or
leveling mobs, and protecting our safe in t he only way you have left us.  

That's all.

Rahnne.

Then he tells me I am not handleing this correctly cause Aginor has a imm and accuses me of playing faviorts.

Text
K, I got PKed by Aginor.  No RP.  As I stated in my previous note, I was
under the impression that Enhanced Characters on SoT were being held to a
higher standard when it comes to RP, even with non-guilded.  That being
said, Aginor said to me (with Allen in the room) that he killed me because I
called him Agiwhore on OOC.  First thats not true, second, if thats his
reason thats pretty pathetic.  Discussed it with Allen and he said that no
rules were broken, and I am fine with that, but is that the way that
Forsaken should be acting to newbies who happen to not be guilded?  

Then I get a whole crapload of tells from Aginor telling me that HE got Sebastian banned and if I didnt shut up he would do the same to me. Again....is that how we want Enhanced characters to be acting?
I dont know Aginor, I dont care who he is, it dosent really matter to me.

2 mins later a shrouded and someone else portaled to me ans killed me again. 
Again, andI hate to sound like a whiner, but is getting friends to kill me because he didnt like something he thinks I said a proper way to be acting?

I would appreciate a return note about this.
I am not trying to get anyone in trouble, I would just like some clarification.

Sorry, I guess I misspoke.  I know that what he did is not against the

something that should be going on?  Is getting your friends to kill him
again so you dont have to multikill him, something the SoT staff wants to go

about getting killed, I give a hoot about getting killed TWICE because

Just a thought, or a revelation. If you are mounted, how can you dirt
kick? Why not prevent mounted players from using dirt kick. Everyone
currently goes mounted because of the extreme damage/defense bonuses,
and the seeing you enter/exit is only a small penalty. This would be a
little bit of an equalizer, since classes that need the melee bonuses

I dont want to cause problems, but I was online when Aginor and Mallet
were argueing this afternoon.  I wouldnt have caught onto much but when
Mallet noted that Aginor said something bout the Ban, I thought I needed to
say something.  Because he said something along those lines to me.  The
first time I logged after Diem banned them, I got a tell from him seconds
after I logged saying somthing along the lines of "See what I did? 
Finally!"  I understand he is pleased that he won the situation, but I dont
think its a good idea to have him walking around thinking and saying he has
the power to get people banned at will.  

That being said, I dont think FS should be killing people for petty reasons like
OOC name calling, guilded or not. If that in fact did happen.
I hate to compare everyone to myself, but when I was enhanced I would never have
jumped someone for something that stupid.

But, to Aginor's credit, he did take the ooc arguement to Bitch channel when asked by Allen and I.

alt Kudzu to join his mud...  He aske d my alt to be a imm there and so
fort.  This occured just about 15 minutes ago if you need to check the log
for tells between him and Kudzu.  The reason I note this now...  Is after
this incident occured...  It made me think I'm sure I'm not the first or the
last he will do this too.  And I know you all do not want players formm here
doing it elsewhere...  So maybe warn him or monitor him...  See who he plays
here...  Whattever...  But watch him.  I don't think is good for him to be
approaching people to join his mud.  
Thanks!

Text
Hmm ..  Interesting to say the least...  But one of the main reasons I
play here is because its WoT themed ..  And because its customized more then
the average ROM WoT themed mud.  I lik ehave familiar and unfamiliar...  But
its sorta the unknown that I see coming that I don't particularly care for
in the long run it may be good.  However, I see an unavoidable pwipe coming
if this overhaul is engaged....  That means for me I lose all my time and
effort put into current players etc.  I'm not sure if it will be worth my
wild to stay if things totally change this way...  And there is a pwipe.  I
don't know what it means to be able to have guild names selected and
stuff...  Are they to be wotish or are we parting with the theme altogether.
Maybe there needs to be a little more clarification on the overall theme of
the mud under these changes.  It seems like a mud I would definitely like to
try...  But i'm not tooo sure I like the idea of parting with what we have
right now.  The areas considering to be made...  How long do you figure it
woudl take to revamp the mud to that size and creation.  Maybe have an SoT2
and see which prospers better in the long run.  I don't know but the
overhaul intimidates me personally.  My main criticism would be
customizations of characters and nothing being perm.  Always changing almost
sounds like a texted based everquest or something.  Anyhow, I just thougth I
would put forth my observations for comment criticism...  And peace of
mind...  So it cannot be said that I didn't express a concern for what seems
to be a vast change of pace for SoT.  However, I'm willing ot put forth a
strong effort to show more custome improvements to what we have...  Seeing
we are now on the new site you spoke of for us.  Maybe this could allow an
offshoot of debate that hopefully is mature and productive and not a bunch
of flying egos.  Okay, I said it thats it.  Thanks!

**FORWARD - Original note by Diem**


Control of a city will be gained by placing an artifact on an altar,
that artifact must stay there for 48 hours, if it is ever removed for
more than 1 hour, the counter resets. If it is kept for 48 hours constant
town ownership is granted to that guild. A guild can control EVERY area.
Once a guild controls every area, the age will pass, and the world
will reset. Everything but player stats and a few other things
will be wiped clean. Please note this could take a VERY long time
to accomplish. An average age will take 2-4 months to play.

Just some of my thoughts on the issue.
1. to make this new system work what would the pbase have to be?
2. would there be a pwipe to be able to make these changes?
3. would the pbase be big enuf after pwipe for this to work?
4. and would it end up with one click running the whole mud?

just some questions on how it would go because pbases always 
suffer after pwipe and to have a chance with this system 
I think you would have to be on the biggest guild to stand a chance.
kinda like real life but does that make it better?
early here so if none of this makes sense please ignore this.

While there will always be people who aren't going to like change,
Arianna noted to tinker that she didnt want to play anymore if all of the

or anything, and Im all for starting from scratch, but maybe offer some
insentive to players with uber-time into their characters to hang on for the
neo-SoT thats coming up?  Even by giving them some kind of advantage, the
passing of an age would make them move on to the next thing.  Anyway, just
though Id let you know first hand that some people are starting to get a
little scared, you know?  And I know your empasis is on pbase right now and
there is such a hting as acceptable losses, but just ot reassure ppl give
some ppl's hard work here a chance to spill over into the new SoT.

Taxes.  Lets make the tax system more real.  Taxes could be taken out at
the bank (depositing) and by random tax-man mobs that would roam around and
deduct taxes from you.  Make this bastard killable, but tough.  Should also
have the ability to call on guards (this can be done with progs) to come
defend him as well.  If you kill him, a bounty is put on your head after
some ticks which sticks till they (the mobs who run the government so to
speak) find and kill you.  Also allow Guilds to put bounty on players as
well (has to be a legit reason) in wich other players can collect the bounty
for reward.  This would also work for the system bounty if someone killed
the tax-collecter, a player could pk that other player who killed the
tax-collecter and get rewarded by the overlaying government.

Yeah, but they also had some ability to hide from each other. You
don't have that here. That's why I suggested that each FS be allowed
to guild 1-3 DF, and bond 1-3 more dependant on the pbase size.
Then, each FS and their guilded DF would be able to shroud 
themselves from other DF/FS. They would operate more like terrorist
cells working towards a common goal, but they'd want to fight each
other too.

If you need a new character, let me know and I can arrange it so you can
go through the creation process. Please note that if you are ever asked
by someone to create you a pfile for them and you do this for them that it 
will be considered under the character trading rule. Please do not make me

Perhaps a notice of this IP ban would be appropriate on the SoT website? It might hurt our
newbie intake if people attempt to join the MUD and are put down by a strange and unknown
banning of their IP. Maybe a request on the website that "people who reach this most unfortunate
problem may create a character by emailing (insert an imp or two here) with your AIM name
and (the earlier imp) can contact you on AIM (or whatever other  message system you choose)
and help you create a new character."

1. Solice marries an older woman for her money.
2. His dad marries the woman's daughter cuz she's hot.
3. Solice's father and the daughter have a child.
Okay, the stage is set...

Now, Solice is, theoretically, the brother of the child (now named Bob), because the child
came from his father. However, he is also Bob's grandfather, for he is married to the daughter's
mother. Now, if Bob is his grandchild, and he is Bob's brother, than he is his own grandfather.

The problem isn't the possession of mp3's.  The problem is that these

many mp3s as you want, so long as you own the corresponding CD's.  It's

Subject mp3's~
Text

You know, I don't download mp3's to own them, I download them to listen to them.  A prof
once told me the best way to solve a problem is to offer a solution first.  I don't see
the RIAA doing shit besides trying to cover their asses for making this problem worse
than it really is.

So here's my solution.  Set up a site which allows you to pick from any mp3's, put them
in your "cart" and then listen to each.  Essentially, it's like listening to shit on the
radio, but I don't own them and it'll work with winamp.  That's one solution and would
probably keep me from downloading mp3's for the main fact I wouldn't need to.

Secondly, for those who like to burn CD's, you should be looking to gain support from
the companies who created the burn progs, like Roxio and Nero.  With their support, you
could cut another %'age out of the picture.

And if it comes down to it, the main reason I never go to buy CD's is mainly because
they are way too fuckin expensive and it's out of my way.  If I could pick songs from
a list, have the CD created, designed, and sent to me within a couple days, I'd buy
that shit for like $10.  No big deal.  They could even personalize the CD case.

We all know EVERYTHING is moving towards eSites and if the record companies don't
realize selling CD's in a physical store is outdated, then they deserve to be ripped
off like this.

have an Idea," said the minister.  "Take this hatpin with you.  I will be

jabbed his leg with the hatpin.  "Yes, you are right, Mr.  Jones," said the

" Who is your redeemer?"  He asked the congregation, motioning towards Mrs.

"God!" Mr. Jones cried out as he was stuck again with the hatpin.
"Right agian," said the minister, smiling. Before long, Mr.Jones agian winked off. However, this time the minister did not notice. As he picked up the tempo of his sermon, he made a few motions that Mrs. Jones mistook as signals to bayonet her hus

The minister asked, " And what did Eve say to Adam after she bore him his 99th son?"
Mrs> Jones poked her husband, who yelled, "You stick that goddamned thing in me one more time and I'll break it in half and shove it up your ass!"
"Amen," replied the congregation.

Best way to find it would go be to go to your start -> find ->

Once you replace the old file with the new one, reboot.

When you go surfing you should notice quite a change, like

Ok, so this Best of the Best thing will be reupdated every month to give all players

-Best Mage
-Best Cleric
-Best Form Master
-Best Rogue

Some prizes may be awarded, to those who make this list, now here's the deal about how to
vote for people.  Send a note to "Logain", thats me, and in the subject Write the 
category you want to vote for this player you want to vote for, and in the note make
it "ONE LINE ONLY", write the person's name.  Players can be awarded multiple positions
and different alts of players can be voted for different sections.  This is all legal,
BUT, please vote by only One alt of yours, I am setting my faith in the integrity of
the players of this mud, to vote only once with only one of their alts.

Hopefully this idea will work out nice, if not I can always take it off, by the way 
send in your pictures too! 4 days left only, after that If I don't receive 5 pictures
I'm not going to put a Pictures section on the webpage.

This should be illegal.  Reasons why are:
A) dosen't promote rp
B) isnt legal due to remembering via wholist (as I recall) is illegal
C) can cause issues when involved with pk (ie the excuse of 'I remembered 
him ooc for x reasons'). I need not point how this can create sticky
