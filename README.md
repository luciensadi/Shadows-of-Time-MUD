# Shadows-of-Time-MUD

A modification of Shadows of Time to try and get it to work on modern systems per /u/Kjaryn's request. It compiles and runs on Ubuntu LTS 18.04, but I don't know what schema the database used, so I can't proceed further.

You'll likely need to build a MySQL 5.7 database to work with this.

If you can find a copy of list.h, you can restore the dice game- I had to take it out due to not having that header or anywhere to get it.
