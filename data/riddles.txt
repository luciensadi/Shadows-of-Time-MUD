A dozen Royals gathered round, Entertained by two who clowned.
Each King there had servants ten, Through none of them were also men.
The lowest servant sometimes might, Defeat the King in a fair flight.
A weapon stout, a priceless jewel, The beat of life, a farmer's tool.

I go out drinking every night, returning to my home in the wee hours
of every morning.  No matter how much I drink, I hever get a hangover.
My drink is very well known, but is rarely consumed, served warm and taken
straight from its source.  I am a sucker for a free drink, especially
since I can't live without it.
