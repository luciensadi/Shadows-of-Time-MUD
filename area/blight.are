The Forgotten Mines~
The entrance of this tunnel is cool and dark, with a musky scent of stale
air, heavy with age and stillness.  The silance is in of it's self is
chilling, though the chill is of a differant nature.  A lite mist slowly
rises from the ground into the air as the sound of thunder echo's down the
valley of hills.

Entrance to the abandoned mine~
As you walk in to the entrance you still cant shake the feeling you are
being watched.  As you turn around you hear the faint sounds of foot steps
then they stop abruptley.  You now sence nothing.  You decide to continue on
in, knowing that following you will make it more diffulacte with less places
to hide.

With in the Darkness~
Darkness folds in on you, makeing it almost impossable to see around you,
even though the light of your lanturn is at it's full strength.  Pressing
on, you hear something like a moan, then a blast of air rushes out and the
light fill's the room elumanateing everything reveiling the end of the this
passage and and a large hole with a old wooden ladder deading down.

The Forgotten Mines.~
You just get done climbing the ladder and take a rest as it was a long
climb.  While you are resting you take a look around.  You hold your light
high and scan in all directions but the most you can make out is what seem's
to be a opening to the north, the south, east and to the west.  Not much
else.  As you look back up where you came from, you can see a mist slowly
comming down the shaft.  Perhaps it's a good idea to be getting out of here.

With in the Darkness~
Chooseing to go back up the ladder, directly into the mist turns out not
to be the best idea you've had.  You become traped with in it, no longer on
the rickety old ladder.  Your skin starts to blister as blood starts to
slowly seep from your poors.  Your lungs burn with every breath you take and
you can feel the pain slowly remove you from this life as you slowly slip
into the beyond.  Darkness consumes you, slowly returning you to the
pattern.

Distance Sounds~
Walking along a sound catches your ear's.  It's a lite rumbleing sound,
far off in the distance.  You look around and do not see any clouds, and
your vision is from horizen to horizen in all directions.  Even though
common sence tell's you you should ignore the sound, due to where you are
at, you decide to go have a looksee.

The air grows cooler and strong with the scent of water the further you

what you are sure now is thunder.  There can be no mistake of that.  But,
still you see no clouds.

A Rocky Encline~
The earth seems to sort of slop up slightly, almost like it was pulled up
by some, force.  There is anoter gust of cool wind, though this time colder
and a bit stronger.  As you continue on, you can start to see the begining
of a vast void in the earth.

Standing Before the Precipice~
You are now at a ledge, standing carefully in awe of what your eye's see
before you.  As you look out ahead, you find what was makeing the thunder,
and the gusts of wind.  There is a strong storm doing it's best that it can
below your feet.  As you walk to the ledge small rocks the size of your fist
and they disapear befor your eye's in to the thick storm clouds below. 
Then, it happens, A large strok of lightning spreads and forks over then
entire storm cloud, streaching out and splitting over and over again.  It
then disapears as quickly as it came and then a few seconds latter..  A
rolling thunder echo's up the wall's of the precipice toward you bringing
with it a cold gust of air.  As you look with wonder, the storm spreads over
a vast plan from horizon to horizon, as far as the eye can see.

The Westren Woods~
The fog and mist roll slowly, following no set pattern or path.  The air
is as the air of the night, cool, heavy with moisture.  The trees are all
bare, devoid of leaves.  Twigs snap under the weight of your feet as they
press down on them while you walk.  The sense that these woods have been
dead for some time prevales and seems quiet apparent.

The Westren Woods~
The fog and mist roll slowly, following no set pattern or path.  The air
is as the air of the night, cool, heavy with moisture.  The trees are all
bare, devoid of leaves.  Twigs snap under the weight of your feet as they
press down on them while you walk.  The sense that these woods have been
dead for some time prevales and seems quiet apparent.

The base of the Hill at the mouth of a cave.~
A dark ominous cave, the sound of crunching bits of stone heard echoing
throughout the darkness that lies ahead.  The walls of the cave seem to be
non-existent in the pressing darkness, seeming to engulf everything inside
making odd rock formations hard to see and a pain for unweary travellers. 
To the north can be heard the sound of dripping water, a constant stream of
drops that is annoying to the ears with its rythmatic splashing.

Amazeing, a patch of grass with a few weed's growing up from the rocky
soil near the base of a old tree with few leaves.  Looking around you you
see more of the same, a few hill's in this valley of death.  A mist is
riseing up from the ground slowly drifting as it lingers into the air.  From
time to time, you can hear the crushing sound of rocks move with the heat of
the earth.

looks to be more mountians and to the west you think you see the ruin's of a
city or town.  The path continues east and then south, down the hill.
