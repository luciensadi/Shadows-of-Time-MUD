Loose parchments are lying all over the floor. You can hardly see a way

Crates in Shambles~
Larges wooden crates sit here on stacked upon another. Some of them have
falled to the floor and splintered apart. Dust covers everything so it is
hard to see what was in these crates.

Loose Ledgers~
Loose parchments are lying all over the floor. You can hardly see a way
to walk though without stepping on them. The ink on most of them are faded
and cannot be read. Someone should just thow them away.

Stairs to the Basement of the White Tower~
There are no lights here to guide your way. The cold stone floor has been
left uncovered and the plain stone walls are the only things to see here.
There is a hall that runs North and South.

The Three Arches~
You stand in front of the Ter'angeral used in the cermony to promote
young women from Novices to Accepted. There are three arches one to the
East, one to the West, and one to the North. At the base of each arch is a
small table with a water pitcher upon it.

Dark Storage Room~
Here you see a very dark very full storage room odds and ends have just
been thrown about this room. Several boxes full of items just lay here
gathering dust. In the middle of all this mess is a large red door frame
with corners that never seem to touch and makes to looker dizzy to look to
long.

Before the White Tower~
From here the White Tower extends far beyond your sight into the sky
above.  A path leads from here around the White Tower into a small plaza
which seems to be the home of many flowers and admirers.  The plaza is
probably part of the famous tower grounds where the Warders train.
