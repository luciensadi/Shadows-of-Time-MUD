Parabol~
A cloud of darkness swirls into the shape of a child.

The cloud of darkness embodies a small child, innocent to the eye.  He is

An Antique Shop~
There seems to be no one here, but you catch a glimpse of a small old
lady behind the counter.  The room is very dim and full of dust.  Antiques
line the shelves and stand alone in the corners of the room.  Small cobwebs
hand from the ceiling.

At the foot of a hill~
The small path comes to an abrubt end.  Before you is a small hill which
no one can see the top of.  The hill isn't very steep, so walking up it
would be a walk in the park for those weary of travel.

down the hill and further north of the hill.  The ground is warm from being

A small path~
The small path offers little room for those traveling in numbers.  It's
wide enough for at least two people to walk side by side.  On either side of
the path are small bushes and sprouting trees.  The path seems a bit bumpy,
but walkable.

A small house~
This is a tiny little house.  No one seems to live here except for your
mom sitting in the corner in full clothing.  The stench coming from the
other corner is unbearable and the wind seems to be blowing nice, fresh air
through the very few windows that are in this home.  You take a second
opinion, and leave this home.

The Commoner's Street~
The street consists of the common people of Falme. Small children walk gloomly about
because they have nothing to do here. Citizens pass you on either side and smile at you.
A few beggars approach you for the obvious reasons.

A dense brush~
The brush is very dense, making it almost impossible to see what lies
ahead if you continued north.  Small woodland creatures can be seen from the
corner of your eyes as you walk.  They sit motionless, waiting for you to
leave because they feel that you are a threat.  Few rays of sunlight break
through the dense brush and strike the ground.

The ground seems a bit sluggish.  Every step you take, you sink into the
banks of the pond.  The pond water looks clear itself, and it looks tempting
to just jump in.  Small fish dart in every direction.

A small cave entrance~
It seems a bit dark, but the light coming from outside lightens it up
slightly.  There seems to be nothing here except left over logs that had
been used for fire.  It appears to be a decent place to stay if you had no

small mirror laying on it.  A cool breeze blows in from the window.  Looking
out the window, you can see the Eastern Wall of Falme and the Aryth Ocean.

enveloping the weak with clouds of darkness then stripping them of their
souls appear before you.  Faint smells of blood permeate through the walls
and sicken you.  You step on something and realize it is the hand of a
small, dead child.

The Main Street~
The streets are crowded with citizens of Falme and those visiting. 
Light-hearted laughter can be heard coming from everywhere and conversations
can also be overheard.  Merchant carts are parked everywhere, ready to sell
what they have to offer.  Few soliciters walk up to you and offer their
values.

home.  The little sunlight that pours through the small openings offer a
small sense of security from complete utter darkness.  The road speaks of
it's age and continues south.

A Plain Field~
The land is flat and stretches this way in many directions.  An open area
that allows rays of sunshine to pour through and warm the earth.  The grass
is comforting and allows small life to live about their lives in it.  A gust
of wind rolls over the field and produces a small wavering of the fine
blades of glass in unison.  It just makes you want to stay here and never
leave.

Path around the Walls of Falme~
The bumpy path contains many footprints.  You realize many people have
gone this way to get to the shore and view the grand Aryth Ocean.  Trees
slightly lean with the cool breeze that blows.  Birds sing their songs and
lighten up the day.

A bend in a small alley~

Standing here, you can hear the voices and laughter of many coming from
within.
