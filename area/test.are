Walking in the Forest~
The trail narrows to squeeze between mossy trunks of trees, then widens
into bright clearings, thick with the verdant grass and blooming flowers.
The dappled shape through overhead boughs shelter a miasma of pale fungi,
from tiny caps to the large shelf mushrooms springing from the sides of
the old trees.

Walking in the Forest~
The creaking of tree limbs overhead mingle with the cries of birds and
the chittering of small mammals in the woods all around.  Fallen leaves
rustle with the stirring of the wind, crackling underfoot and exuding
the fragrance of slow decay.  The trail here winds around thick tree
trunks and between short ferns growing green beside it.

Walking in the Forest~
As you walk through the low vines and leaves that inhabit the ground,
you notice the density of the forest surrounding you.  Fallen trees
and huge limbs make it difficult to travel.  In some parts, sunlight
can barely penetrate the canopy, making the terrain hard to judge.  A
few animals can be seen from time to time, seeming startled by your
presence.  Fortunately the forest looks a little less rough in the
distance.

Walking in the Forest~
The creaking of tree limbs overhead mingle with the cries of birds and
the chittering of small mammals in the woods all around.  Fallen leaves
rustle with the stirring of the wind, crackling underfoot and exuding
the fragrance of slow decay.  The trail here winds around thick tree
trunks and between short ferns growing green beside it.

Walking in the Forest~
As you walk through the low vines and leaves that inhabit the ground,
you notice the density of the forest surrounding you.  Fallen trees
and huge limbs make it difficult to travel.  In some parts, sunlight
can barely penetrate the canopy, making the terrain hard to judge.  A
few animals can be seen from time to time, seeming startled by your
presence.  Fortunately the forest looks a little less rough in the
distance.
