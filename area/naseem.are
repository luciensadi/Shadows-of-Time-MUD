Performing gleeman~
A tall man in a multi-coloured coat is performing here.

A man is standing here swirling his multi-colured and patched cloak
around. He has black hair with streaks of white at the temples, and
his eyes are the colour of slate. His mouth is partially hidden by
a huge drooping mustache, and there are many laugh lines around his
eyes. His voice seems to be coming from every part of the room, and 
it alters pitch and timbre continuously.

Dusty Gravel Road~
You come upon a road that is considerably wide.  You can tell the
hard-packed dirt road has been used often, yet note recently.  Trees line
the road on either side blocking much of the view ahead of you.  Many cart
tracks and footprints lead eastward toward something you will have to see
for yourself.

Continuing along the hard-packed dirt road more tracks begin to appear
going eastward.  A strong breeze blows creates a tiny twister of dirt on the
path.  The breeze moves some of the trees and one would be able to see
something white up ahead if they look.

Continuing along the dirt road and the breeze that is going westward
seems to become a little stronger than before.  The leatherleaf trees are
back in place and nothing can be seen up ahead but wooded land.  All that
you can see besides the trees in your path is a glimmer of the sun beaming
down on you.

Continuing along the hard-packed dirt road one could notice that the
leatherleaf trees are becoming less and the area is not as densely wooded as
before.  Glancing towards the west all you can see are trees behind the
path.  Eastward is something that resembles a bridge.

Eastward on the hard-packed dirt road is something that slightly
resembles a bridge or staircase.  However, up ahead it seems like it looks
more like a very big and thick cloud.  Westward is too dense with trees to
see anything but a dirt path and some tiny critters.

can see.  Nothing can be seen eastward all that is there is flat land and
what you think might be a path downward.  Little critters are litter the
floor and even though they cannot speak or communicate they seem to urge all
other living things to continue eastward.

shifts.  It almost looks like a fold in the air which is impossible.  Many

something strange.

on the sides of the road.  You can see something shift quite a bit eastward.
It looks like a curved line in the air which seems very odd.  As if reality
is changing and folding.

This is a dilapidated old hut, made from a crazy collection of wood, iron
and plastic.  A wonky looking bunk can be seen in the corner, along with its
threadbare mattress.  From outside the howls of dingoes can be heard, the
grunts of possums and other night life of the Australian bush.  A fire place
is positioned in one wall, where a fire burns brightly and several pots hang
from hooks over the fire.

The hallway still appears to be running in a straight line, but it is
hard to tell.  Monotonous and boring are good descriptions of the hall. 
Glancing back, no doorway can be seen leading into the hall, and no can be
seen leading off the hall.  An endless journey lies ahead.

The Stone-Paved Square~
You are in the stone-paved square which is the center of this city. 
Everyone who comes in this city needs to pass through this square in order
to leave.  All the inns are also in this square and you can see one
northward.

Path to the Docks~
There is little of interest on the path from here to the city.  There is
the odd individual moving along the path, and a small group of merchants who
are just starting onto the path.  As can be seen along the length of the
path, it is worn, but it is kept to a usable condition.

heads directly to the city.  The area that it enters the city must be the
merchants area, judging by the large number of shops that can be seen from
here.  There is another group of merchants ahead, they are just starting to
make their way along the path.

in full view.  It is a fairly large and well set out city.  Taller buildings
can be seen interspersed with single level buildings.  There is a large
square in the centre of the city which has several streets leading from it. 
The southern half of the city and the square have a large number of planted
trees, creating a lot of shade.

well made, there are few bumps in paving and no large gaps were paving
stones are missing.  This is as can be expected of a well used and travelled
path.  A group of merchants are moving along the path, towards the docks.

Further along the docks edge, and the view has not changed to much at
all.  People are still rushing about, working and resting.  There are some
mysterious looking swirls that arise in the water, there are no obstacles to
be seen that would suggest how they are formed.  Their formation looks to be
entirely random.

Stepping on board of the docked ship, deck hands and sailors are running
around organizing the ship's unloading.  It is probably best to move some
where else on the ship, to get out of the way of the work being done.  There
is a stairway to the north leading up to the next level of the ship, might
be the place to be to get out of the road.  There is a short set of stairs
leading down into the bow of the ship

fish rising to the surface in search of food.

city on stone floating in midair.  The only way here seems to be through the
bridge of clouds.  The fact that a beautiful golden gate is sparkling before
you is nothing compared to seeing a city floating on this.  The island in
air is given the name Naseem Island or Breeze Island when translated.

patronised.  Someone can be heard playing a harp and singing along.  Many of
the patrons also are attempting to sing along, it makes for a most horrid
noise.

Common Room of the Wayfarer's Rest~
The common room of the Wayfarer's rest is dominated by a huge stage, it
stands in the centre of the room.  A gleeman is upon the stage playing his
harp and singing, around the stage are the inn's tables.  Most of the
benches that accompany the tables are full, there are a few empty places on
the benches but no table is fully empty.

Common Room of the Wayfarer's Rest~
This is the south eastern section of the common room, if it can be said,
it is quiet or at least quieter than the rest of the inn.  Those patrons in
this area are paying less attention to the gleeman, and more time quietly
talking amongst themselves.  All are relative well dressed, they look to be
merchants.

Common Room of the Wayfarer's Rest~
As the inn's stage is so large, the common room cannot be crossed
directly.  To get to the other side the patron's must move around the stage.
This is not a problem though, as there are two bar areas, on on either side
of the stage.  Each bar has three people standing behind it serving
customers directly or filling the orders given to them by the waitresses.

Common Room of the Wayfarer's Rest~
It is a little bit difficult moving in around the tables, because of the
number of patrons and waitresses dodging backwards and forwards to the bar. 
Most people look to be entranced by the gleeman's performance, many swaying
in time to the music, and even singing along.

This is the northern most end of the inn, the stage covers the middle of
the floor to the south and east.  This section of the room has ten tables
and all of them are filled, there is a stream of waitresses moving in the
area serving patrons.  The waitresses seem unharried, in fact most look to
be very happy and go about there work with smiles, grins and laughter.

gathered in that area.  Some of the patrons are moving either up or down the
stairs.  In this section of the common room, all eyes are on the performing
gleeman.  The numbers of waitresses is no less here, and the bar staff are
working frantically to keep up with the orders.

There are few less tables set in this section, this is mainly because of
the stairs that lead up to the second level.  One or two patrons can be seen
moving up or down the staircase, most likely there are rooms upstairs.  All
in all the trade of the inn looks to extremely good, the owner must be doing
well for theirselves.

common room.  The gleeman is slowly turning around in circles and using the
whole of the stage, so he is including every one in his performance.  Just
to the east there is a large stairwell leading up to the next level.  Down
that side of the stage are more tables and benches, most are full.

As can be expected with such a busy inn, the kitchen is in full fly. 
Cooks and their helpers are moving rapidly around the room preparing food to
be served to the inn's patrons.  One old man standing in the corner is
yelling at every one else, he must be the head cook.  The smells emanating
from the various pots and pans on the fires and the stoves is mouth
watering.  This inn must have a good name amongst the local populous.

pies of different sorts.  Others sell vegetables and fruits, herbs and
spices are sold from some other stands.  The smell of cooking meat comes
from four stands clustered together, they are selling various sorts of
cooked meats, that are cooked on the spot.  Next to these stands are two
others that have un-cooked meat on display.

There is a slight break in the numbers of hawkers to found here.  This is
most likely because of the small alley that leads of the street to the west.
The alley is mostly in the shade, and some movement can be seen from within
the shadows.  The smell of cooking meat is drifting from the south, it
mingles with the odour of rotting rubbish coming from the alley.

display.  A matronly old woman is standing behind a counter, she stops what
work she is performing to serve customers when needed.  A man of the same
age can be seen moving around the rear of the shop, he is wearing a pristine
white apron.

Tannery~
The is a very unpleasant odour emanating from this building, as the case
with most tannery's.  Cured hides are hanging from the walls, and layered in
piles on shelving and the floor.  Through a half open door at the back of
the room, the main area of the tannery can be seen.  There are huge vats
placed in this room, most have several men weilding large paddles which they
are using to stir the vat's contents.

Produce Shop~
There is lines of stands running the length of this shop.  They are
covered in various types of produce.  On one side the stands are full of
different types of fruits, some seem to be exactly the same.  The other half
of the shop is dedicated to vegetables, leafy vegetables can be seen sitting
next to root vegetables of varying types.  At the back of the shop there is
a small secion that has a range of spices on sale.  An older man and woman
are slowly moving around the shop asking patrons if they require any help. 
Two young men can also be seen moving around the shop, they are fixing and
adjusting the displays.  Where necessary they are filling them.

Goldsmith~
There is little on display in this shop, and those items that are are
either richly decorated with gold or gold leaf.  Some items even look to
made from pure gold.  One cabinet holds chalices and goblets, another has

Blacksmith~
Entering the blacksmith's is like walking through a wall of heat.  The
shop itself is divided into two areas.  The front half is a small sales
area, with some weapons on display.  Most of the items on display are every
day things, like iron grills, plough and other gardening equipment.  The
second part of the shop, and by far the larger is separated by a small iron
fence.  Behind the fence there are four furnaces, of which two are in use. 
Two young men are working at the operating furnaces, one is hammering out
some metal on an anvil, the other is merely heating up some metal.

Back Alley~
The dim light of the alley makes vision a little difficult.  Judging by
the damp smell of the alley, not much sunlight penetrated to the alley
floor.  The smell of decay is strong in the alley, and things can be felt
being quashed under foot.  The noice of the hawkers is still quite audible
this short distance into the alley.

water can be heard, and the faint scrape of booted feet.  The decaying smell
is even stronger again.  Piles of rubbish make navigating the alley a little
difficult.

cooler than the streets in the sun.  Only trickling water can be heard, the
noise from the competing hawkers has disappeared.  Rodents scratching in the
rubbish can be heard.

Smuggler's Square~
Descending the ladder, the floor of the room comes up sooner than normal.
The room itself is pitch black, without bringing a light into it, nothing
can be seen.  Feeling around the corridor, anyone over five foot would have
to crouch.  The walls are wet and covered in slime, feeling along the walls
and creeping the length of the corridor seems alomst freaky.  Heavy
breathing can be heard coming from somewhere around here.

Standing in the middle of an intermeditary room, whispers are floating in
from every direction.  A table in the centre has a lantern placed on it, it
adds to the glow of the torches mounted on the wall.  It almost looks as
thought the lantern and torches are being moved from their original places
to others.  Something very strange is occurring within these underground
chambers.

the side of the stairs filled with tomes, and a divan is set next to it. 
The divan is covered in plush cushions and would be an ideal place to curl
up and read a book.

furnishings, the rug is looking a little threadbare.  Most of it looks
extremely well made, just old and well used.  The books that are on shelves
on the wall are all worn and the scrolls are all well creased.

it.  A samll glass fronted cabinet is in the corner, it is full of glassware

The smell emantating from a large cauldron over an open fire is however
singularly delicious.  Having old equipment does not stop the cook from
preparing great food.

into a scene of a fishing boat in the middle of the ocean.  The sailors on
board are hauling a net onto the boat.  A old man is making his way down the

chests sit at the top of the stairs, the engraving has been detailed with
gold and silver.  A tapestry is hanging above the chests, it is of a young
man standing by a war horse his hand is at his waist resting on the hilt of
his sword.  Another two hilts are poking over his shoulder and a bow is
hanging from the saddle horn.

The colours in the tapestry are exquisite, the cloth used to make it seems to hold the colour well. The stitching is also of excellent quality, this piece of art is a real master piece.
The depicted man is very handsome and looks confident, there is even a sense of arrogance in his stance. The corners of his mouth are tweaked slightly, as if he is amused by something.

The crowd of sailors is lessened, even this little bit further along the

One or two can be seen moving down the ramp to the docks, to help with that
end of the unloading process.  Every now and then a shudder can be felt
passing through the ship as it hits the dock.

tasks.  Yelled orders can be heard over the confusion of voices.  The
creaking of windlasses moving the cargo nets mixes in with the babble of
voices and the cries of the birds overhead.  Curses can be heard
interspersed with the yelled orders and the general welter of noise.

There is no need to dodge quickly moving sailors here, the majority of

in this area are performing tasks that require patience and not speed or
strength.  Simple tasks such as repairing sail cloth, others can be seen
checking for damage to the hull and railings in this area.

Bow~
The ship goes no further, this is the bow.  Stretching back to the east

starboard is all quiet, with little movement, whilst the port side is full
of hurrying sailors, completing the loading and unloading of cargo.  From

levels of the ship.

as are the men working the docks.  The chatter and curses of both groups of

Here on the starboard side of the stern, it is rather peaceful.  There is
little noise of the noise of the docks and the bow area reaching here. 
Mostly it is the quiet slap of water on the ship's hull, the odd creaking
board of the deck and the call of the gathered birds.  The Arinelle
stretches to the horizon in the north, on either side of it green fields can
be seen.  There is the odd copse of trees breaking up the fields.

forwards on various errands and jobs.

through the backstage which is slightly inconvenient.  The bartender is
making numerous drinks at once and a few maidservants crowding the room.  
The smell of great food is coming from the south.

stairs and at the other end a window is set into the wall.  The two doors
located here are flanked by a pair of medium sized tapestries.  The

pictured.

Hallway~
The end of the hall, a window is set into the wall here it looks out over
what looks like a park, there are many trees growing there any way.  The
window and the two doors here have large tapestries flanking them.  A
picture is hung above the window, all of these depict scenes of battle. 
Human against human and human against monsters.  Judging by the distance to
the last two door ways, the rooms on either side here are large.

of furniture.  A large dresser is against one wall, a writing desk is
against the wall on the opposite side of the bed.  Finally there is a large
wardrobe standing beside the door.

Large Bedroom~
This room is huge, there is a bed standing against the southern wall
under a window.  By the its sheer size it must have been made for Ogier. 
Two wardrobes stand side by side against one wall and a dresser is against
another wall.  There is a desk by the door and the accompanying chair is
much too big for a human.  
 
This really must be an Ogier room.

Entrance to The Drunken Chorus~
You have entered an inn called The Drunken Chorus.  To the south is the
common room.  The walls look pretty old and a little dirty.  When you glance
into the common room you can see a bunch of drunken men singing rauciously
and raising their mugs together.  I guess this inn's description fits the
name.

There are circular wooden tables with old and moldy chairs nearby.  There
are a few mugs here, but not one is left full.  A man lies on the floor and
looks as if he has been beaten over the head with a bottle of ale.  Towards
the front of the common room is a stage and what looks to be like a gleeman.
