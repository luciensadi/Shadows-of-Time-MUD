The rear of the stable~
You are in the back of the stable. Horse pens are on either side of you,
further towards the back you see a ladder leading to the loft. You better
watch your step, oops too late. You look down in disgust as you realize you
just stepped in a large deposit of horse manure.

strong smell of garbage. Beside the entrance to the kitchen you notice a
small pan of milk sitting out. Obviously put there for the cats, an inn's

of the alley, and wrinkle your nose as the wind brings a whiff of it to you.
Glancing to the north, all you can see is alley, but it must lead somewhere.

includes people travelling in from the gates at the wall. Their cloaks are
often covered in dirt from their trek, and they lead horses behind them more
often than not. An alley branches off to the south.

You have entered into a small weapons store. On either side of the wall
hangs various weapons. From daggers to battle axes this place has them all.
Some look to be worn and on the verge of breaking others finely polished.
Further back into the store you see the weapon smith.

The Eastern Road~
The eastern road upon which you travel is a hard earth street. All of the
main streets in Ebou Dar have remained unpaved, to prevent costly repairs. Most
of the side roads, which endure less traffic, have been finished with
cobblestones.

The Eastern Road~
You are standing just west of the eastern gates that are one of the
entrances into Ebou Dar. The area surrounding the gates is busy with people, but
you are very close to the wall road that encircles the city. The wall road
is often deserted, save the presence of thieves and other unsavory types.

The eastern gates stand tall above you. You have reached one of the
entrances that lead into Ebou Dar. The wall is directly ahead of you, an
impressive creation of stone and mortar that must have taken generations to
complete.  The gates are high archways, and stand almost twenty feet high.

competing with each other for customers, and the sounds of horses
transporting people and goods.

widely around them. The water doesn't look to clean, and it doesn't seem the

As you proceed along the docks, you see a myriad of people making
their way through Ebou Dar.  City guards pass you as they walk their
circuit of the city. Hopeful beggars cry out to you, desperate to get
a coin or two.

Along the Docks of Ebou Dar~
The docks of Ebou Dar are a long stretch of planks and ships along the
southern edge of the city. The harbor is full of ships - some are
moving by sail, while oars are visible from the sides of others. Flags
are run up the masts, signifying the nationality of the ship's crew
members.

The Inner Grove~
You move further through the grove. You are towards the back of the
forest at the moment, far removed from the wall road of Ebou Dar. The sky is
perfectly clear, not a cloud in sight, making for a beautiful day to visit
the grove.

The Inner Grove~
The inner grove is extremely peaceful, off the beaten path that leads
through the grove. The trees here are even taller, if that can be possible.
They tower high above you, branching out to touch each other in an intricate
weaving. It's hard to discern where one tree ends, and its neighbor begins.

The Inner Grove~
You are in the inner grove, walking along an almost forgotten path. Green
grass has managed to recover what was one a well travelled trail. Small
bushes with berries dot the ground. You reach down to pluck one of the
berries, which is a deep red color. It is ripe and sweet when you eat it.

- hickories, evergreens, pines, and elms share the soil. Most of the trees
are tall, with massive trunks. Their size indicates they have survived many
years, and by the looks of them, will continue to do so for quite some time.

to maintain the area for centuries.

You stand at the end of Brawler's alley, where the market road branches.
Empty buildings with broken, dark windows are on both sides of the road. The
people here look at you suspiciously, unwilling to trust anyone who ventures
down this way.

Proceeding down the alley, you realize the area fairly dark. Many of the
lanterns here have been damaged, and provide little to no light. You wonder
if it's because few people want to venture down here to fix them, and they
have simply been neglected, or if the alley population destroys them on
purpose.

They are fighters by profession, and take their progress very seriously.
Just watching them training, you know they are not people you would want to
anger.

As you walk down the street known only as Brawler's Alley, you notice
that people are looking you over, as if appraising you for strengths and
weaknesses. You begin to look around warily, watching out for someone in
search of a fight. This is not an area of town where help will appear should
something happen. Most citizens avoid this street at all costs.

the walls. Some are beautiful, gilded maps intended to be tapestries in
noble homes. Others are small and simple, easily fit into a satchel or
pocket. The map maker seems to be very good at what he does.

The Unlucky Mark Tavern~
You stand inside the double doors that stand at the entrance to the
tavern known as The Unlucky Mark. The room quiets down a bit as you enter,
and you can feel eyes looking you up and down. You hesitate before you
continue to make your way.

The Unlucky Mark Tavern~
You are in the back room of the Unlucky Mark tavern. Gaming tables are
here, crowded with players. Gold is dropped on the tables with great
abandon, and ale mugs are emptied quickly. Women dangle themselves around
the men, hoping to get some of the money that is being spent so easily.

You step through a secret door, into a smoky room above the tavern. You
can faintly hear the sounds filtering up from the tavern, but this room is
deadly silent. Several men are in the room, lined up to speak to one man
behind a desk at the far end. This is where the assasins come to receive
assignments, and trade secrets.

The Illian Road~
The Illian Road is a long expanse of paved road that connects the two major
port cities of Ebou Dar and Illian. There are a few trees that line its
curves, but the land is turning into a marshy area. Pools of marsh water can
be seen, with willows sprouting along their edges.

to the stables. The pungent smell of horse manure begins to fill the air,
making you wrinkle your nose in disgust. Hopefully, one of the stableboys
will take care of that soon.

to this, and calmly shoot a glare at the offending man before
continuing about their duties.
