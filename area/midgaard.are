    To whom it may concern,

        Merc Industries has installed a new no-rent save and quit
        system.  Apparently one can now save and quit at any time
        from anywhere inside a town or out.  My services here are
        no longer required.

Queen's Way~
The winding road of Queen's Way continues to the south and east, bordered
with majestic trees and dwelling of the townsfolk.  Here and there a
goodwife goes about her daily chores, tending small flowerbeds, or setting
baked goods to cool in windowsills, the sweet scent of apples drifts lazily
on the light breeze.

Here at the beginning of what the local citizenry refers to as Carter
Way, the road becomes gradually more worn.  Though paved, the cobbles are
obviously well-used, and the flagged stones show signs of rutting where the
carts for which they are named have so often travelled.  The street extends

the coronation of kings whose faces are lost in memory, noble men and women
sitting in judgement in vast halls.  An overall sense of majesty hangs over
this place, peasants and townsfolk around you keep their voices low and move
from room to room with reverence.  Wide marble steps lead up to the entrance

Outside the Eastern Gates of Whitebridge~
You are standing by a gap in the wall of what is the main entrance to the
small city of Whitebridge.  You can see the curving arch of the White Bridge
as it extends west from the city's center.  Two rather tall towers stand on
both sides of the worn and rusted iron gate.

from one tower to the other.

Within the Healing Chamber~
Several men and women are gathered within this peaceful healing chamber. 
The walls are made of a beautiful obsidian colored marble, and the floor is
covered with soft bearskin rugs.  The chamber is engulfed with peaceful, and
soothing music.  Towards the center of the chamber, are a set of marble
stairs that lead down to a fairly large room below.  To the north is arched
doorway that leads into a fairly large room, filled with both men and women.

A Small Hidden Shop~
This shop is damp and there is a foul odor of mold and sewage in the air.
Everywhere around you are various items from weapons to armor and even some
miscellaneous objects.  The room is lit only by a small lantern hanging from
a peg on a support beam.  There appears to be no exits to this room.

The Fountain of Youth Apothecary~
An old man putters around behind the counter, making strange love potions
and curative philtres.  He turns as you enter, and looks on with avarice.
Judging from the furnishings, he's been made very wealthy by his trade.
