Subject Punishment for Leaving Treaty~
Text
There was never an agreement that said, "If you want to leave the treaty,
you must FIRST note GL's, Guide, and Dreyus.  Otherwise, punishment will
insue."  IF that would have been stated, I can assure you 100% that
Sebastian would have noted everyone BEFORE he did anything.  Therefore, I
everyone BEFORE he did anything.  Therefore, I vote no on any punishment to
be insued on Sebastian and Whitetower.

Subject Punishment~
Text
By the same token, it was never stated that guilds COULD leave the treaty once they were
in. The White Tower had originally chosen to be part of the treaty. No one twisted Seb's
arm to do it, nor did anyone force so many players to abandon their guilds to flock to WT.
However, both actions were done, and now White Tower has pulled out. Just because punishment
was not decided upon beforehand doesn't make them immune, it makes them unwise to have left
before verifying there would be no punishment. But hey, I'm just a Tinker.

I jumped the gun.  Now that I have read what the rest of you all have to

saw where that lead us.
