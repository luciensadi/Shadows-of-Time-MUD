As you step on board a Tairen ship, you have to move quickly to avoid the
sailors who are coming on and off the ship.  Everyone is too busy loading
and unloading cargo to notice you snooping about.

of the paint looks to be blood.  The hallway ends abruptly, with a small
hole in the ground, and a steel pole next to it with a rope tied around it.

Scrawled on the wall in blood are these words:
I find that I can see a light at the end,
Down beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole. 
Defeated, I concede and move closer.
I may find comfort here, I may find peace
Within the emptiness.. How pitiful.
 
And in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping,
The moon tells me a secret, my confidant.
As full and bright as I am, this light is not my own.
A million light reflections pass over me,
It's source is bright and endless.
 
And as I pull my head out, I am without one doubt.
Don't want to be down here, soothing my narcissism.
I must crucify the ego, before it's far too late.
I pray the light lifts me out, before I pine away.
To leave this place behind, so negative and blind and cynical.

I can sink no further, and I cannot forgive you.
There's no choice but to confront you, to engage you, to erase you.
I've got to great links to expand my threshold of pain,
I will use my mistakes against you.. There's no other choice.
Shameless now, I'm nameless now.. I'm nothing now, I'm no one now.
But my soul must be iron. Because my fear is naked.. I'm naked
And fearless, and my fear is naked.

Scrawled on the wall in blood are these words:
Twisting and spinning towards an inevitable destiny,
Leaving behind all that holds me here.
Spiraling into the eye of chaos,
Staring straight back at insanity.
Closing my eyes to drown out the spinning,
Opening my mind to enter the eye.
 
Letting go of a world that confines me,
Embracing a reality that accepts me.
Falling into a web of eternity,
Clinging to the memories of past lives.
Drifting into a whirlwind of chaos,
Giving away all my earthly possessions.

And tangled was I in my own web of deception,
So much that I was blind to the world around me.
Given the chance, I would surely go back and
Change things for the better. But as it is, I
Am still trapped in the depths of my own mind.
Let me go: Break the chords which hold me in
Place, so that I may once again be free to
Explore the reaches of insanity.
 
To build one's future is to destroy one's
Past. To destroy the past, is to destroy the very
Foundation of what we've become. Feed me the very
Freedom that my soul hungers for. Take me away from
This disaligned world where there is a consequence
For every action, and a burden with every consequence.
Give me serenity, an exit from this web I weave around
My soul.

Leaving only the worms to feast upon the flesh of the Slaughtered.
When the Blood of the Innocents flows throughout the land,
Then the Angel of Chaos will ascend from the Underworld.
With him will be Nine Sages of Darkness,
To assist in his Ultimate Reign.

I opened my eyes today..
I woke up, and nothing was the same.
While I was asleep for what seemed like years,
I dreamt beautiful things that brought my eyes tears.
But when I awoke in this red-tinted world,
Nothing was the same.
 
I followed my footprints back to my dream..
To find if anything was as it once seemed.
I realized then, as the years moved on,
My footprints dwindled, then faded till gone.
The memories of my past life, so carefree and pure,
Is now a tease in this Terror for which I seek a cure.
 
Seems like yesterday, when I laughed and I played,
And now today I sulk, and I cry, and I pray.
I pray to a Creator who I've never seen,
And ask him to once again make my life carefree and clean.
Now more than yesterday, I ask to see..
The fading footprints, leading back to my dream.

The Heart of Chaos~
As you descend into the Heart of Chaos, it's now clear where the screams
of agony and smell of decay were coming from.  Corpses line the circular
room, some hanging from the ceiling, half eaten, others torn apart on the
ground.  The gruesome scene is only made worse by the presence of a massive
being in the center of the room, obviously the cause of the screams, the
source of Terror.  Just like the other rooms, there are words scrawled on
the wall, only these are the words of the victims, not of the Torturer: 
 
Here I sit, dark and cold, ice seeping through the cracks in my bones.
My mind plays tricks and threatens my sanity, paying the price for my
Overcharged vanity. I sit and wonder, and after a time, I start to think
Back, forced to ask why. Lonely subdued, and frightened I dwell, locked
In this prison, my personal Hell. When fear fades to hate, and hate turns to
Sorrow, I begin to knot up, in envy of tomorrow. Tomorrow brings another
Beginning, and my first ending. Darker and darker, and colder I grow. Now
I know the things that make me so.

hall.  Aside from the paintings, there isn't much else to be seen.

Further down the hall, more paintings adorn the walls, and the same blood
red carpet covers the long floor.  Looking at the ceiling, you notice
despite the small size of this house, the ceiling seems to stretch high out

Almost at the gates, the main road to Tear is moving along rather
quickly.  The guards at the gates stand at attention, but aren't stopping
anyone from entering or leaving.  This close to the city itself, sounds of
life can be heard from inside.

On the Side of the Stone~
On the side of the Stone, there are people rushing to and fro.  Despite
their hurry, they seem to take comfort in being beside the Stone, as if
knowing that nothing bad can happen as long as the Stone stands.

Standing directly before the entrance to the Stone of Tear, you are in

successfully.  Mentioned twice in the Prophecies of the Dragon, it is said
to only fall when the People of the Dragon come, and when the Dragon's hand
falls on Callandor, The Sword That Cannot Be Touched.  In any case, it's an
amazing fortress.

This alley seems rather different than the others in Tear.  For one
thing, it's clean.  It's also well-lit, and no one seems to be sleeping on
the ground or feeding on something dead.  Perhaps it leads someplace nice.

An Alley~
As you enter the alley, you notice the building that is on the other
side.  Something about the wall seems preculiar, as if it's a facade.  Also
the fact that a heavily armored guard stands in front of it gives reason to
believe something may be behind it.

The Bedroom~
The High Lord's bedroom is magnificent.  Almost as large as the audience
chamber, the decorations that add to the beauty of the room look more exotic
and expensive.  The bed is twice as large as the guest beds, covered with
several pillows and silk sheets.  His closet is huge, containing more
clothes than anyone could possibly need.

A Private Room~
This room is Aracome's private room.  There isn't much in here, besides a
long cushioned chair made for two people to sit on.  Aside from that, there
is a large window, and a wine cabinet.

The Dining Room~
The dining room is big enough to suit a large audience, with a table
roughly 40 feet long and 10 feet wide.  A beautiful chandelier hangs above
the table, adding to the beauty of the room.

A Well Kept Kitchen~
The kitchen is filled with cooks and servants, yet there are no messes to
be seen.  They seem to be keeping it perfectly intact at the same time that
they are rushing about to meet their guests' needs.

High Lord Gueyam's Manor~
Inside the High Lord Gueyam's Manor, you can see why guards are necessary
to protect his home.  Priceless Tairen rugs cover the floor, and the finest
Sea Folk porcelin vaces are placed in niches carved into the walls.  The
furniture looks of Kandori quality, and the walls themselves almost seem to
have been made by Ogier.

An Audience Chamber~
The audience chamber in the High Lord's manor is nonetheless elegant and
exquisite as the front room.  Exotic paintings and statues line the walls,
their origin hard to determine.  A huge chandelier hangs from the ceiling,
right above a beautiful carved square table.  On the north wall, a tattered
scroll hangs on the wall, depicting a man with red hair wielding a sword
against a man with eyes of fire in the sky.

A Construction Site~
Strangely enough, the south wall of Gueyam's manor is missing.  It looks
as if lightning struck the house, or maybe some strange Power is
responsible.  There are several men working to repair the wall.

Outside the Manor~
Near Gueyam's manor, you notice a huge hole in the manor and several
workers attempting to repair it.  Maybe with a disguise a person could slip
into the house unnoticed.

Outside Aracome's Manor~
Leaving Aracome's manor, you step outside into his private garden. 
Shortly to the east begin the docks of Tear, and the activity of sea life.

A Lesser Noble's House~
Entering this noble's house was quite easy, considering there are no
bodyguards about.  This house is very modest, and from the look of things,
being unkept, the noble clearly doesn't stay here very often.

A Noble's House~
Standing before another nobles house, the guards here are quite attentive
to their job.  They eye everyone who passes, even women and children.  Of
course, some of the children here look rather dangerous...

High Lord Meilan's Residence~
The High Lord Meilan's house seems rather plain for a noble.  Only one
story, it's not very big and the outside isn't very decorated.  Perhaps the
High Lord doesn't spend much of his time here.  You also notice there are no
guards.

A Square~
Several people are gathered around the square here to view the
entertainment that usually goes on.  Despite the busy atmosphere in the
city, this square is proof that the citizens still have time to enjoy life.

The dirt road runs next to the gravel road, but with less people due to
it's tendancy to get muddy at times.  It seems less messy than most of the

A Guard Post~
The guard post is where all the guards come to rest for a moment after
they are releaved, and to check to see when they have to stand guard next. 
Even the guard post seems guarded.
