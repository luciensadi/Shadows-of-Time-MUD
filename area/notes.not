**FORWARD - Original note by Demiscus**

Alright guys,
 
I'm sick and tired of Shadow (in the history of this mud), basically shrouding themselves,
and questing, and not participating in Roleplay and things enough.  Basically, you are
going to have to be required to roleplay, and I want you not to just roleplay as some
ordinary person.  I want you to act like a Shadow would in the books.  You don't have to
blatantly spell out your a Shadow, but you can sure as hell talk to people by whispering to
them, and maybe even find some followers.  Basically, RP your truly a follower of the Dark One
in some form or another (Even if its on a minor scale), at least one person out there should
know your a Shadow.
 
I want Shadow's to actually create a struggle.  In the books, it always felt like the Shadow were
a step ahead of the others.  The Last Battle always felt like it was nearing, and Shadow always
proposed some sort of conflict, shaking the world.  You can't just sit and quest, and shroud all
day. My 2 cents.
 
-Demiscus
 
P.S. You guys will be dictating how major events will take place on here (RP & PK) wise, so please,
stimulate roleplay.

Text
Taking a new step for Shadow,
 
Shadow is now composed of 5 Forsakens, yes, you heard me right.  We are restructuring it
so that Shadow is only composed of FS, and all darkfriends, black ajah, etc. will be either in other guilds
or be unguilded.

A new Rand has also been appointed, to offset this sudden strike of FS.  I hope you will
all see some new Roleplaying challenge, as well as player-killing.  We'll see how this works out, in the meantime
roleplay will be heavily awarded by Imms in the form of QPs, gold, etc. and we'll do this by looking at logs.
 
This should alleviate the problem of Shadow not roleplaying as they should be, or sitting in safe, being shrouded
all the time, or simply not evolving the roleplaying gameplay.

**FORWARD - Original note by Ryalin**

Alright fella's, I decided it's not really fair of me to stay in Shadow. 
I can help w/ RP all I want, but I'm kidding myself if I think I can do any
more than that.  I'm not a strong PKer as it is, but my logging is done at
work, when I'm on telnet.  Being at work is the biggest problem, because I
cannot ever guarantee any activity.  I'm also starting to remodel the
apartment my boss is giving me, so it's really going to cut back what I'm
going to be able to log at night.  Therefore, the best thing I can do for
Shadow is to not take up space.  A namless IMM has agreed to let me leave
guild for free.  I won't be reguilding, and I donated 500 qp to your
coffer...  Put it toward some healing furniture.  Hope there is no hard
feelings...  I'll still be your darkfriend when I get the chance though!

Basically, the algorithm has longer bars for fewer people, then switches to
smaller bars for each person so it can fit them on one line. Below is
basically what it looks like. Clerics either just spam heal on themselves,
spam sim, or spam heal on a single person, whether anyone needs it or not.
This would help them decide on where their heals will go.

`!1293`8/1293 `$286`8/1271 `@703`7 `1170890`!x`7 0|

Archim Kimber Nagash Demisi Roneth Kinson Cheese

One slightly easier alternative would be to spit out percentages instead
(this i did not code, cuz no one wanted it).

`^100`7%  `@93`7% `^100`7% `^100`7%  `#45`7%  `!28`7%
Arch Kimb Naga Demi Rone Yoda

If the numbers and bars are at least are kept all on one line, it makes it
stupidly hard to parse so don't worry about heal scripts.

I know I have my code backed up somewhere. Where should I email it to?

We have every right to check up on your logs, and see whether your cheating
or not.  If you don't like it fine, leave.  Cheating is something that will NOT be
tolerated, and I am trying my best along with Dewalt & others to stop it.  Given your
guys history: cheating, stole the mud from me in past, etc.  I'd really not talk about
who schemed what.  We are simply talking about how to make the game legitimately cheat free.
 
Don't forget your history, you stole the mud, and it died along with it.
 
This will always be how it is, no cheating allowed, ever, period.  if you don't like
being interrogated about certain suspicious logs, thats fine I admit it might come off as
rude, but it is just to make the mortals have a fair game and chance.

My point, is that if you see something that is suspicious, come out and
ask about it.  I have no problem playing in a cheat free environment, none
at all.  I've seen what happens when things run rampant.  But before you
bash on w hat we did with "our" mud, and i dont remember stealing it, not
that i doubt it, i just dont remember, but we had a ppbase in the m id 30's
with balanced guilds, new skills, spells, classes, etc.  My main issue is
that your never going to have a successful mud if the imps argue and spy on
each other constantly.  It doesnt just affect the people whose every action
gets looked over, it keeps you from doing what needs to be done.  Im an
un-front person, i dont mind you saying something to my face, i might
respond to it, but id rather hear it than see it behind my back. Thats all
im trying to say here.  And i will say whatever i want, i will accuse you of
scheming if i want, i dont care what happened in the past, im not
discrediting it, but whats important is the here and now.  And the other
thing is, no one is uncomfortable about being interogated.  You know why? 
Beccause you havent done it you just take action without hereing what
happened.  I'm not even disagreeing with the action you take, just the
manner in which you get there.  Oh, and by the way, my chars have always
been within 100 hp of being klegit.  Note format And thats because i
generally kept shit inline, i only gave myself the last couple trains til
legend b/c waiting for qlist just sucked, plus, it was our mud.  Seeing as
it was our mud, we also must look at whether or not we cheated.  No where
did we define cheating as applying to imp alts, therefor we were innocent,
thank you very much.  And i barely put myself in the 'cheater' category as
that just about every other imp has done more than that.  Basically, to sum
up, which means this is the only important part of the whole damn note is,
just come to me if you have a problem with me, go to tanis if you see a
50000 qp token, go to stoicm, do whatever, jjust dont go behind our backs. 
Sometime id apologize for the length or the spelling thdx to telner, but i
dont really feel like it.

What are you questioning, Demiscus?  We don't even know.  Let's see what

Uh.  I tried to buy a token worth 20000 qps and 50000 qps to see if it still
noted IMP, since Saitoh was under scrutiny about her store..  And it does. 
I loaded a piece of eq for Saitoh and a couple other people for turning in a
Quest EQ Coupon to me.  VNUM is 24600 for Saitoh's.  I dunno what else.... 
Main thing is, we don't want the drama anymore Demiscus.  If you think we

Subject Recent Issues.~
Text
Not really back till Sunday, but I wanted to give my two cents.  First of all,
Demi, you're bipolar sometimes.  You kinda just go with whoever is on.  If Tanis 
or myself are on and saying something you agree.  If Dewalt is saying something
completely opposite an hour later and we're not on, you agree with him.  So I
think one of the biggest issues is you just need to make up your mind on whether
or not you trust us.  If you don't trust us, why do you have us here?  Bottom line
is I haven't helped my mort any more than resetting the quest list trying to get 
pracs with qps that I earned with my MORT.  The funny thing is, i tried twice and
didn't get pracs either time.  The next thing is, I'm just here to help the mud
grow and to help YOU.  If I wanted to steal the code, don't you think I would be
trying a little harder to do that?  Besides...since when do I have the time to
completely run a mud on my own?  PFFT.  That's why I'm here as an imp just backing
you up.  But if you're just going to spend extra time coding stuff to spy on us
rather than something that will actually HELP the mud, then why am I here wasting
your time?

Another thing is, you need to LEAD this mud if you're going to be the owner.  I
completely agree that the imp staff should vote on some issues, but that doesn't
mean that you should be able to be swayed at the drop of a hat.  If every time
another imm brings something up you change your mind, this isn't going to be a very
stable mud, and eventually you'll lose morts because you go back and forth on 
stuff so much.  If you're gonna imp something, stick with it longer than just enough
time for one or two people to bitch about it.  You're the leader, I'm here to back
you up, but the problem is...I don't know which side of you to back up!  One day
you're telling us that we're doing good...the next you're plotting with Dewalt and Acebo
behind our backs to catch us in the act of cheating...an act I might add that doesn't exist.
So you need to make up YOUR mind...do you trust us or not?  

One last thing before I go until Sunday.  Dewalt, if you got something against me, Tanis, 
or Saradin...BRING IT TO US.  You'd think spending a little time in the Army would help
you grow some balls...

I'm out....be back Sunday.

Text
If a person or group of people attempt to initiate RP with you, for the
sake of RK, and you dodge it more than 3 times...  It's automatic RK.  The
stipulation here, is that the person cannot be AFK.  What this also means,
is that if you do not want this rule used against you, you'd better get an
AFK flag on or LOG OFF!  Instances of RP being ignored are just as easily
logged as the RP being ignored, and if it continues, there will be NO PK
here at all.  If you're afraid to give RK and get in a fight, you should
have joined Tinker.  Or, you could stay unguilded and dodge a lot of it. 
Whatever the case, you can't dodge RK forever.  Eventually, you will be in a
fight: win, lose, or draw.  As always, if you have any questions regarding
this or other rules of RK/PK, feel free to contact Guide, myself, or Stoic
for clarification.

Also, I have an idea for how to get some more PK action, let me know if this

How about another shadowspawn race: Trolloc.  Upon creation as a trolloc, you will
get all skills at 100%, and a stock set of eq.  You will not have any RK required to
PK someone, but your not allowed to RP either, since your a trolloc.
 
Upon being killed, your character will just die permanently, and be deleted.
This'd provide some fun, and i'd set a max of how many trollocs can be on the game at a

Just since I've been gone since a little before thanksgiving, I'm going
to input on the issue.  Regarding me being named a "co-conspiritor" of
sorts, all I've ever done was suggest a course of action since Demi can
sometimes be, as was noted before, a bit fickle.  When asked what I should
do if one of the imps was caught cheating "Fucking get rid of them". 
Concerning adding a new, "secret" channel "Eh, maybe not a great idea". 
I've been pretty much only given the info about the alleged cheatings and
never seen the logs or done the legwork.  Having a history definately
defines how serious you're taken when you see "load obj #" alot but, I
haven't judged any of the D-town crew beyond someone giving me some info and
asking for my suggestion.  In closing, I don't want the actions of Dewalt or
Demi to define me in my absence.  

I don't disagree on the "IMM-staff" vote, and I wholly agree that Demi needs to
either step up or, as he's done with RP, set a manager of policy over general MUD
issues.

Sorry if I've been distant while feeling out the Denison crew again, but

Well, I've got to rule w/ Janus on this one...  Female channelers cannot

Text
I don't have enough time to code the whole war thing yet, in the interest of time,
if your a GL and would like to declare war on a guild, note me which guild.  I will
add a command called "warstatus", which will show current guilds and who is at war
with whom.  RK is not needed for any guilds at war.  The guild you are declaring war
against MUST have at least 3 members.  

If you want to get out of a war, give the GL 100k gold on behalf of your guild, and note
immortal and me.

Once again, keep looking for the command called : WARSTATUS
 
 
_Demiscus_
 
P.S. Shadow will be at war with everyone automatically, in which case, they do not need RK to attack you..but
they will be forced to roleplay.

If something is crashing, you can use the GDB debugger, it'll tell you exactly which line and what file
is causing the problem..and do a backtrace:
 
-Go into SoT/area
-Type gdb ../src/sot
-This should bring you into the debugger mode, type run 5001. (or 5000).
-Mud should start up, go ahead and try and crash the mud.
-Upon crashing, the mud will lag, go back to your debugger window, you should see a line where the immediate
crash took place.
 
-Type "backtrace", or "bt".  This will show you a series of occurences on why it crashed.
 
This should help you fix the bug..you can also try typing "info locals" to get info on which character caused it, etc.

You need a pbase more than anything right now.  And to keep a good pbase
you need to have somewhat balanced classes so definately make that a
priority which i know it is.  Second, you need another coder to help, i
dunno how much acebo does, but one more wouldnt hurt.  Third, you need
builders for the world map, i had not one application in the month we've
been on-line.  Fourth, you need less apathetic players, ones that actually
dont just write about what to do to change the mud but are willing to do it.
Last, if you label me a cheater, i swear, i will kick you so hard in the
nuts its not even funny.  Nothing i did every adversely reflected on the
place, the 5 trains is piddly shit, i never even played the char after. 
Does that justify it, no, it shouldnt happen.  Im not leaving b/c of the
demotion by the way, its just the final straw.  The rest of the reasons have
nothing to do with mud, got to much going on outside here to play here. 
Plus, god damnit, i just got my wii and zelda is awaiting.  The only way the
demotion pisses me off is that you'll call me a cheater, cuz god damnit i
pride myself on my morals and ethics, as everyone should, and never judge
anyone til you meet them or know them.  Which i should tell myself because i
judge people everyday that i probably shouldnt.  All in all, good luck on
finding more players, that will solve most problems, and dont make any
rash/hasty decisions, they rarely work out well.  If for some reason i cant
fathom you need to talk to me, ask jaro or tanis if they are still around.

Subject Castle (Go to "the Creator")~
Text
This is how it works:
 
 
You MUST enter the area by portaling to "The Creator", do not goto any of the
other vnums, that'll mess it up.  Just goto "The Creator".
 
 
Commands:
 
Syntax: claim
Before you do anything, you need to claim the room for your guild.
 
 
Syntax: assign <safe, recall, remove>
Assign the particular room as your guild safe room, or make it your recall room (Recalling still unfunctional), or you can
remove the room entirely, it won't be your GUILD's any longer.
 
Construct <wall, gate, tower>
 
Construct a wall to form a border, you cannot walk past walls.
Construct a gate, only your guild can pass through the gate.
Tower, construct a tower, (in future, if a tower is destroyed, you lose your guild QPs).  Put the tower inside your guild walls to make it safe.
 
_DEMI_
 
Here's an example of a Castle Layout:
 
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| |#|#|#|#|#| |       #: represents one section of wall
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| |#|G|G|G|#| |       =: represents east gate 
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| |#|G|G|G|=|*|       *: Is you.
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| |#|G|G|G|#| |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ You can walk only in the blank spots.
| |#|#|#|#|#| |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Other commands:

Syntax: map
When you enter your guild area inside the walls (G), it will show you a roomname/description
intsead of the usual map.  Type map to show the map.

Syntax: mapsize
Change the size of the map.

Subject Roleplay Enforced~
Text
In light of recent events,
 
I am now switching the mud to a roleplay enforced category.  What does this mean exactly?
It basically changes the way the mud works.  One of the main ways your character will advance
is through roleplaying.  You will have to build a personality for your character.  Another great
way to advance your character, is by posting stories about what your character experiences, in the RP note
board. Ask an Immortal if you need assistance.
 
One more thing, your character should not be using any Out-of-character information to judge others.  Anything
you say about another player, has to be known to your CHARACTER.
 
This won't take away from the mud, it'll add more flavor.  We still have OOC for those who love talking
out of character, and I hope OOC will still be widely used for social discussion (Not PK ranting).

 
_DEMI_
 
P.S. Be sure to make a description for yourself (help description), and restring your equipment (help restring or ask an IMM)

Subject World map, lets begin~
Text
Okay guys,
 
It's time to step it up and start working on the World Map.
To get to the world map, goto 37789.  That brings you to the entrance
of Whitebridge.  Basically, we need Room Names, and a 1-2 line description (very basic)
for each room...probably even mobiles (that can come later).
 
Go here for a good map:
http://www.ess-a.com/wotmania/images/WoT_Map_by_New_Name.jpg
 
You can match up whats on that map in the link I gave, with our
world map in-game.
 
`8#`7 = Road
`3^`7 = Mountain
`3-`7 = Hill
`2@ `7= Forest
`@.`7 = plains
`^X`7 = City.

The blue is water.
 
Basically, at each `^X`7 will be an entrance to an area (a portal), if you find cities
that aren't shown on our map, tell me which VNUM you think they should be in, and I'll
add it.
 
Make sure the portals are set to charges > 50k or 100k, or the portal winks out after you enter it.
 
If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask.  Let's start cranking out the world map to get it finished
so we can open it up to players.
 
ALSO: Make sure you vae worldmap setting on (type worldmap).
If you want to turn it off (and look at the desc/name), turn it off (type worldmap again).
 
If your worldmap is OFF, but you'd like to see it, type "map"

**FORWARD - Original note by Demiscus**

If something is crashing, you can use the GDB debugger, it'll tell you exactly which line and what file
is causing the problem..and do a backtrace:
 
-Go into SoT/area
-Type gdb ../src/sot
-This should bring you into the debugger mode, type run 5001. (or 5000).
-Mud should start up, go ahead and try and crash the mud.
-Upon crashing, the mud will lag, go back to your debugger window, you should see a line where the immediate
crash took place.
 
-Type "backtrace", or "bt".  This will show you a series of occurences on why it crashed.
 
This should help you fix the bug..you can also try typing "info locals" to get info on which character caused it, etc.

Hello everyone, the world map is in!  I'll be adding a helpfile, (help mapping), pretty soon
to let you guys know about the system and what symbols are (most are obvious).
You'll find that when you exit certain city gates or areas, you get sent to a map.  First off,
make sure to have the map on (type : worldmap), or you won't see it.  
 
You may change the size of this map : mapsize <1 - 50>
 
Also, you may turn it off, to see Room names/descriptions (type worldmap again).  If you have
it off, you can still see where you are on the map by typing : map.
 
If you have any questions please ask the IMM Staff.  There are some areas which are marked as cities
`^X`7, but are still unbuilt.  Type help "worldmap", for a list of incomplete and complete cities.

5. Increase steal, make it to where we can steal from what they are wearing.
6. Stop taking from us, we are the weakest class in the game.
7. I can't even kill mobs for quests anymore, without it taking 5 years.
8. Make it to where when you're cloaked people cant port to you.
9. Give us a skill that lets us remove hidden daggers from areas, so that we get at leeast some extra hits.

Thats all I got for now, all I really want is fucking third back.

Subject Traps and Porting.~
Text
With the advent of no porting in PK tics as well as traps being as they are, if you get trapped in PK an archer can wail 
away and the victom has nowhere to go.  Was this intended?

Subject too much~
Text
Ok archers were given far too much.  traps allow damn near 700 hps 
of damage happen before trap wears off.  second off to add 
to their damage is rediculous the deal damage without taking 
any.   Seben didnt know what he wsa doing if he complaind because 
i fought him and i saw what he was doing with an archer.
now a fs cant even kill an archer.

Could we maybe have it changed so that traveling the world map doesn't

Greetings all, I would like to create a database of walking directions to
any known areas.  I haven't been here very long, so this may already be
available.  But, if it is not available, and if you know the directions to
any given area, please note me with them.  This would be valuable to me and
any new players who can't seem to find their way around.  Once the database
is started, I'll find a way to share it with other players....  If that is
okay with the imms, of course.
